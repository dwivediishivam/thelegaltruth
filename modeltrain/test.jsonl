{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: moreover a sales tax is an indirect tax which can be passed on by the seller to the purchaser. the sales tax acts passed by the legislatures of several states provide for the seller collecting the tax from the purchaser as does the u. p. sales tax act xv of 1948, vide section 8a. that could be done only if the tax was levied before the sale took place. therefore by the very nature of it there could be no retrospective legislation in respect of sales tax. and finally it is argued that the imposition of a tax retrospectively would be inconsistent with the provisions of the u.p. sales tax act, 1948, and could not have been contemplated by that act. such for example are the provisions of section 8a which provide for the registration of dealers for (1) 11 the assessment years, the deposit into treasury of sales tax collected from the purchasers in certain contingencies, section 14 of the act which imposes penalty for non registration under section 8a, and rule 63 which provides for the deposit of the sales tax collected under section 8a(4) within thirty days of the expiry of the month in which the amount is charged. it is accordingly contended that whether we have regard to the true features of the sales tax legislation or the provisions of the u.p. sales tax act, the validation act could not be held to be one with respect to sales tax, that it is therefore not within entry 54, and as there is no other entry in list ii or list iii of the seventh schedule to the constitution, under which the legislation could be justified, it must be held to be ultra vires. so ran the argument. the point for decision., stating it succinctly, is whether the validation act is within the ambit of entry 54 in list ii of the seventh schedule to the constitution. that entry confers on the states authority to enact a law with respect to tax on sales of goods. now what is the extent of that authority? there must be in fact a sale as recognised by law. it is only then that a tax could be imposed. but if the transaction sought to be taxed is not a sale, a law which seeks to tax it, treating it as a, sale, would be ultra vires. thus in the sales tax officer vs messrs. budh prakash jai prakash (1) a tax on agreement to sell was held to be not authorised by the entry, and in the state of madras vs gannon dunkerley & co., (madras) ltd. (2), a tax on the supply of materials in a contract for the construction of works simpliciter, on the footing of a sale was held to be outside the entry, and the legislation which imposed such a tax was struck down as ultra vires. but where the transaction is one of sale of goods as known to law, the power of the state to impose a tax thereon is plenary and unrestricted subject only to any limitation which the constitution might impose, and in the exercise of that power, it will be competent to the legislature to impose a tax (1) ; (2) ; 12 on sales,which had taken, place prior to the enactment of the legislation. but it is urged on the strength of certain observations in the province of madras vs boddu paidanna and sons (1) that a sales tax is a tax on the occasion of sale, and that therefore it could not be imposed with retrospective operation. this contention is, in our judgment, wholly without substance. now, the point for decision in that case was whether a tax imposed by a provincial legislature on the sale of oil by a person who manufactured it was bad on the ground that it was in essence an excise duty. while a sales tax could be imposed by a provincial legislature, an excise duty could be imposed only by the federal legislature. in holding that the tax in question was a sales tax and not an excise duty, the court observed as follows: \"the duties of excise which the constitution act assigns exclusively to the central legislature are, according to the central provinces case, duties levied upon the manufacturer or producer in respect of the manufacture or production of the commodity taxed. the tax on the sale of goods, which the act assigns exclusively to the provincial legislatures, is a tax levied on the occasion of the sale of the goods. plainly a tax levied on the first sale must in the nature of things be a tax on the sale by the manu facturer or producer; but it is levied upon him qua seller and not qua manufacturer or producer.\" (p. 101). in the context, the words, \"on the occasion of the sale\" have reference to the character of the transaction and not to the point of time at which the duty becomes leviable, and they have no bearing on the question as to when such a tax could be imposed. and then it is argued that a sales tax being an indirect tax, the seller who pays that tax has the right to pass it on to the consumer, that a law which imposes a sales tax long after the sales had taken place deprives him of that right, that retrospective operation is, in consequence, an incident inconsistent with the true character of a sales tax law, and that the validation act is therefore not a law in respect of tax on the (1) 13 sale of goods, as recognised, and it is ultra vires entry 54.", "completion": "the sales tax acts passed by the legislatures of several states provide for the seller collecting the tax from the purchaser as does the u.\nit is accordingly contended that whether we have regard to the true features of the sales tax legislation or the provisions of the u.p. sales tax act, the validation act could not be held to be one with respect to sales tax, that it is therefore not within entry 54, and as there is no other entry in list ii or list iii of the seventh schedule to the constitution, under which the legislation could be justified, it must be held to be ultra vires.\nthat entry confers on the states authority to enact a law with respect to tax on sales of goods.\nbut where the transaction is one of sale of goods as known to law, the power of the state to impose a tax thereon is plenary and unrestricted subject only to any limitation which the constitution might impose, and in the exercise of that power, it will be competent to the legislature to impose a tax (1) ; (2) ; 12 on sales,which had taken, place prior to the enactment of the legislation.\nand then it is argued that a sales tax being an indirect tax, the seller who pays that tax has the right to pass it on to the consumer, that a law which imposes a sales tax long after the sales had taken place deprives him of that right, that retrospective operation is, in consequence, an incident inconsistent with the true character of a sales tax law, and that the validation act is therefore not a law in respect of tax on the (1) 13 sale of goods, as recognised, and it is ultra vires entry 54."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: we see no force in this contention. it is no doubt true that a sales tax is, according to accepted notions, intended to be passed on to the buyer, and provisions authorising and regulating the collection of sales tax by the seller from the purchaser are a usual feature of sales tax legislation. but it is not an essential characteristic of a sales tax that the seller must have the right to pass it on to the consumer, nor is the power of the legislature to impose a tax on sales conditional on its making a provision for sellers to collect the tax from the purchasers. whether a law should be enacted, imposing a sales tax, or validating the imposition of sales tax, when the seller is not in a position to pass it on to the consumer, is a matter of policy and does not affect the competence of the legislature. this question is concluded by the decision of this court in the tata iron & steel co., ltd. vs the state of bihar (1). the following observations of das, c. j., bearing on this question might be quoted: \" under the 1947 act the primary liability to pay the sales tax, so far as the state is concerned, is on the seller. indeed before the amendment of the 1947 act by the amending act the sellers had no authority to collect the sales tax as such from the purchaser. the seller could undoubtedly have put up the price so as to include the sales tax, which he would have to pay but he could not realise any sales tax as such from the purchaser. that circum stance could not prevent the sales tax imposed on the seller to be any the less sales tax on the sale of goods. the circumstance that the 1947 act, after the amendment, permitted the seller who was a registered dealer to collect the sales tax as a tax from the purchaser does not do away with the primary liability of the seller to pay the sales tax. this is further made clear by the fact that the registered dealer need not, if he so pleases or chooses, collect the tax from the purchaser and some times by reason of competition with other registered dealers he may find it profitable to sell his goods (1) ; 14 and to retain his old customers even at the sacrifice of the sales tax. this also makes it clear that the sales tax need not be passed on to the purchasers and this fact does not alter the real nature of the tax which, by the express provisions of the law, is cast upon the seller. the buyer is under no liability to pay sales tax in addition to the agreed sale price unless the contract specifically provides otherwise. see love vs norman wright (builders) ltd. if that be the true view of sales tax then the bihar legislature acting within its own legislative field had the powers of a sovereign legislature and could make its law prospectively as well as retrospectively.\" (pp. 1378 1379). the decision of this court in buchirajalingam vs state of hyderabad (1) is also to the same effect. the power of a legislature to enact a law with reference to a topic entrusted to it, is, as already stated, unqualified subject only to any limitation imposed by the constitution. in the exercise of such a power, it will be competent for the legislature to enact a law, which is either prospective or retrospective. in the union of india vs madan gopal(2) it was held by this court that the power to impose tax on income under entry 82 of list i in schedule vii to the constitution, comprehended the power to impose income tax with retrospective operation even for a period prior to the constitution. the position will be the same as regards laws imposing tax on sale of goods. in m. p. v. sundararamier & co. vs the state of andhra pradesh (3), this court had occasion to consider the validity of a law enacted by parliament giving retrospective operation to laws passed by the state legislatures imposing a tax on certain sales in the course of inter state trade. one of the contentions raised against the validity of this legislation was that, having regard to the terms of article 286(2), the retrospective legislation was not within the competence of parliament. in rejecting this contention, the court observed: (1) a.i. r. , 759 60. (2) ; (3) ; 15 \"article 286(2) merely provides that no law of a state shall impose tax on inter state sales 'except in so far as parliament may by law otherwise provide '. it places no restrictions on the nature of the law to be passed by parliament. on the other hand, the words 'in so far as ' clearly leave it to parliament to decide on the form and nature of the law to be enacted by it. what is material to observe is that the power conferred on parliament under article 286(2) is a legislative power, and such a power conferred on a sovereign legislature carries with it authority to enact a law either prospectively or retrospectively, unless there can be found in the constitution itself a limitation on that power.\" (p. 1460). and it was held that the law was within the competence of the legislature. we must therefore hold that the validation act is not ultra vires the powers of the legislature under entry 54, for the reason that it operates retrospectively. it was finally urged on the basis of sections 8 a, 14 and rule 23 of the u. p.", "completion": "but it is not an essential characteristic of a sales tax that the seller must have the right to pass it on to the consumer, nor is the power of the legislature to impose a tax on sales conditional on its making a provision for sellers to collect the tax from the purchasers.\nwhether a law should be enacted, imposing a sales tax, or validating the imposition of sales tax, when the seller is not in a position to pass it on to the consumer, is a matter of policy and does not affect the competence of the legislature.\nthis also makes it clear that the sales tax need not be passed on to the purchasers and this fact does not alter the real nature of the tax which, by the express provisions of the law, is cast upon the seller.\nif that be the true view of sales tax then the bihar legislature acting within its own legislative field had the powers of a sovereign legislature and could make its law prospectively as well as retrospectively.\" (pp.\nvs the state of andhra pradesh (3), this court had occasion to consider the validity of a law enacted by parliament giving retrospective operation to laws passed by the state legislatures imposing a tax on certain sales in the course of inter state trade.\n(2) ; (3) ; 15 \"article 286(2) merely provides that no law of a state shall impose tax on inter state sales 'except in so far as parliament may by law otherwise provide '.\nwhat is material to observe is that the power conferred on parliament under article 286(2) is a legislative power, and such a power conferred on a sovereign legislature carries with it authority to enact a law either prospectively or retrospectively, unless there can be found in the constitution itself a limitation on that power.\" (p."}

(hereinafter called the company), was engaged in the business of transporting passengers by bus between dharapuram and palni, among other places, in the state of madras. on september 20, 1947, one of the buses of the company, bearing registration number mdc 2414, left dharapuram for palni at about 3 p.m. at a place called thumbalapatti between dharapuram and palni, one rajaratnam, along with his brother by name krishnan, boarded the bus. the bus met with an accident at about 3 miles from palni, as a result of which some of the passengers, including rajaratnam, sustained injuries. rajaratnam died of 932 the injuries received in the accident on september 23, 1947. the first plaintiff, his father; the second plaintiff, his widow; and plaintiffs 3 to 7, his sons, instituted 0. section no. 7 of 1948 against the company in the court of the subordinate judge, dindigul, for compensation under section 1 of the (hereinafter called the act) for loss of pecuniary benefit sustained by them personally, and under section 2 thereof for the loss sustained by the estate on account of the death of rajaratnam. they alleged in the plaint that the driver, who was in charge of the bus, was incompetent and inexperienced, that he was guilty of rash and negligent conduct in the driving of the bus, and that the accident was the result of his incompetence and negligence. the company in its written statement denied the said allegations and leaded that the accident was the result of the central plea of the left rear spring suddenly giving way, that rajaratnam was also guilty of contributory negligence and that in any event the damages claimed were excessive. the learned subordinate judge came to the conclusion that there was no proof that the bus was driven at a reckless speed at the scene of the accident, but the fact that the accident occurred on the off side of the road was itself evidence of his negligence and it had not been rebutted by the defendants. he further held that the driver was not proved to be incompetent. on those findings, he held that the defendants were liable for the negligence of their servant, and be awarded damages as follows: (1)plaintiff 1 . rs. 3,600 under section 1 of the act. (2) plaintiffs 2 to 7. rs. 25,200 under section 1 of the act.

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: under those acts the balance of loss and gain to a dependent by the death must be ascertained, the position of each dependent being considered separately.\" lord wright elaborated the theme further thus at p. 611: \"the damages are to be based on the reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefit or benefit reducible (1) 939 to money value. in assessing the damages all circumstances which may be legitimately pleaded in diminution of the damages must be considered. the actual pecuniary loss of each individual entitled to sue can only be ascertained by balancing, on the one band, the loss to him of the future pecuniary benefit, and, on the other, any pecuniary advantage which from whatever source comes to him by reason of the death. \" the same principle was restated with force and clarity by viscount simon in nance vs british columbia electric railway company ltd. (1). there, the learned lord was considering the analogous provisions of the british columbia legislation, and he put the principle thus at p. 614: \"the claim for damages in the present case falls under two separate heads. first, if the deceased had not been killed, but had eked ou t the full span of life to which in the absence of the accident he could reasonably have looked forward, what sums during that period would he probably have applied out of his income to the maintenance of his wife and family?\" viscount simon then proceeded to lay down the mode of estimating the damages under the first head. according to him, at first the deceased man 's expectation of life has to be estimated having regard to his age, bodily health and the possibility of premature determination of his life by later accidents; secondly, the amount required for the future pro vision of his wife shall be estimated having regard to the amounts he used to spend on her during his lifetime, and other circumstances; thirdly, the estimated annual sum is multiplied by the number of years of the man 's estimated span of life. , and the said amount must be discounted so as to arrive at the equivalent in the form of a lump sum payable on his death; fourthly, further deductions must be made for the benefit accruing to the widow from the acceleration of her interest in his estate; and, fifthly, further amounts have to be deducted for the possibility of the (1) 940 wife dying earlier if the husband had lived the full span of life; and it should also be taken into account that there is the possibility of the widow remarrying much to the improvement of her financial position. it would be seen from the said mode of estimation that many imponderable enter into the calculation. therefore, the actual extent of the pecuniary loss to the respondents may depend upon data which cannot be ascertained accurately, but must necessarily be an estimate, or even partly a conjecture. shortly stated, the general principle is that the pecuniary loss can be ascertained only by balancing on the one hand the loss to the claimants of the future pecuniary benefit and on the other any pecuniary advantage which from whatever source comes to them by reason of the death, that is, the balance of loss and gain to a dependent by the death must be ascer tained. the burden is certainly on the plaintiffs to establish the extent of their loss. both the courts below found, on the evidence the following facts: (1) the family owned a building worth rs. 2,00,000 at palni, and 120 acres of nanja land worth about rs. 1,000 per acre. (2) it was engaged in the business of manufacturing indian patent medicines from drugs and had been running a siddha vaidyasalai at palni for a period of 30 years and had also branches in colombo and madras. (3) rajaratnam studied in the indian school of medicine for two years and thereafter set up his own practice as a doctor, having registered himself as a practitioner in 1940. (4) he took over the management of the family vaidyasalai at palni. (5) rajaratnam was earning in addition rs. 200 to rs. 250 per month in his private practice.

(7) he was aged 34 years at the time of his death and, therefore had a reasonably long span of life before him, if the accident had not taken place. on the said findings, the high court summarized the position thus: 941 age 34 carrying on business as a doctor, with reasonable prospects of improving in his business. he was living in comfort and by his early death plaintiff, , 2 to 7 have lost their prospects of education, position in society and even possible provision in their favour. under the circumstances, the award of rs. 25,000 as damages must be accepted as quite reasonable. \" when the courts below have, on relevant material placed before them, ascertained the said amount as damages under the first head, we cannot in second appeal disturb the said finding except for compelling reasons. assuming that rajaratnam had not died, he would have spent, having regard to his means and status in life, a minimum of rs. 250 on respondents 2 to 7; and his income, as indicated by the evidence, would certainly be more than that amount. the yearly expenditure he had to incur on the members of the family would have been about rs. 3,000 and the sum of rs. 25,200 would represent the said expenditure for just over 8 years.", "completion": "the actual pecuniary loss of each individual entitled to sue can only be ascertained by balancing, on the one band, the loss to him of the future pecuniary benefit, and, on the other, any pecuniary advantage which from whatever source comes to him by reason of the death.\nfirst, if the deceased had not been killed, but had eked ou t the full span of life to which in the absence of the accident he could reasonably have looked forward, what sums during that period would he probably have applied out of his income to the maintenance of his wife and family?\" viscount simon then proceeded to lay down the mode of estimating the damages under the first head.\naccording to him, at first the deceased man 's expectation of life has to be estimated having regard to his age, bodily health and the possibility of premature determination of his life by later accidents; secondly, the amount required for the future pro vision of his wife shall be estimated having regard to the amounts he used to spend on her during his lifetime, and other circumstances; thirdly, the estimated annual sum is multiplied by the number of years of the man 's estimated span of life.\n, and the said amount must be discounted so as to arrive at the equivalent in the form of a lump sum payable on his death; fourthly, further deductions must be made for the benefit accruing to the widow from the acceleration of her interest in his estate; and, fifthly, further amounts have to be deducted for the possibility of the (1) 940 wife dying earlier if the husband had lived the full span of life; and it should also be taken into account that there is the possibility of the widow remarrying much to the improvement of her financial position.\nshortly stated, the general principle is that the pecuniary loss can be ascertained only by balancing on the one hand the loss to the claimants of the future pecuniary benefit and on the other any pecuniary advantage which from whatever source comes to them by reason of the death, that is, the balance of loss and gain to a dependent by the death must be ascer tained.\n(7) he was aged 34 years at the time of his death and, therefore had a reasonably long span of life before him, if the accident had not taken place.\n\" when the courts below have, on relevant material placed before them, ascertained the said amount as damages under the first head, we cannot in second appeal disturb the said finding except for compelling reasons."}

(3). there lord macmillan described the nature of the two heads thus at p. 610: \"the rights of action in the two cases are quite distinct and independent. under the law reform act the right of action is for the benefit of the deceased 's estate; under the fatal accidents acts (1) (2) (3) 944 the right of action is for the benefit of the deceased 's dependents.", "completion": "the second proviso to section 2 of the act reads: \"provided that in any such action or suit, the executor, administrator or representative of the deceased may insert a claim for and recover any 942 pecuniary loss to the estate of the deceased occasioned by such wrongful act, neglect or default, which sum, when recovered, shall be deemed part of the assets of the estate of the deceased.\" while section 1 of the act is in substance a reproduction of the english fatal accidents acts, 9 & 10 vict.\nwhile under section 1 damages are recoverable for the benefit of the persons mentioned therein, under section 2 compensation goes to the benefit of the estate; whereas under section 1 damages are payable in respect of loss sustained by the persons mentioned therein, under section 2 damages can be claimed inter alia for loss of expectation of life.\nthough in that case it was held that the father was entitled under both the acts, lord atkin made the following observations, which are appropriate to the present case: \"i should add that i see no difficulty as to the alleged duplication of damages under the act of 1934 and the fatal accidents acts.\nit was held that, as the husband was the claimant under both the acts, credit should be given in assessing the damages under the fatal accidents acts, for what was given to him under the law reform act, 1934.\nso too, in ellis vs raine (2), where the parents of an infant, who had been negligently killed in an accident, claimed damages under both the acts, goddard, l.\nj., reaffirmed the view that where the parties who would benefit from the damages awarded under the fatal accidents acts were the same as those who would benefit from the damages awarded under the law reform act, the damages under the fatal accidents acts must be reduced by the amount given as loss under the law reform act."}

(a) of sub section (1) of section 5 of the (act xi of 1948) (hereafter called the act), to hold enquiries and advise the government in fixing minimum rates of wages in respect of employment in the tile industry and nominated eight persons to constitute the said committee under section 9 of the act. this notification was published on august 14, 1957. the committee made its report on march 30, 1958. the government of kerala then considered the report and issued a notification on may 12, 1958, prescribing minimum rates of wages as specified in the schedule annexed thereto. this notification was ordered to come into effect on may 26,1958. on that date the present petition was filed under article 32 by the nine petitioners who represent six tile factories in feroke kozhikode district, challenging the validity of the 'act as well as the validity of the notification issued by the government of kerala. the state of kerala is impleaded as respondent to the petition. the petitioners allege that the minimum wage rates fixed by the notification are very much above the level of what may be properly regarded as minimum wages and it was essential that before the impugned wage rates were prescribed the employers ' capacity to pay should have been considered. since this essential element had not been taken into account at all by the committee as well as by the respondent the notification is ultra vires and inoperative. according to them the burden imposed by the notification is beyond the financial capacity of the industry in general and of their individual capacity in particular, and this is illustrated by the fact that nearly 62 tile factories in trichur closed soon after the notification was published. the petitioners seek to challenge the validity of the act on several grounds set out by them in clauses (a) to (g) of paragraph 21 of the petition. it is urged that the act does not define what the minimum wage is to comprise or to comprehend and as such confers arbitrary authority on the appropriate governments to impose unreasonable restrictions on the employers. 'the law conferring such arbitrary power is violative of article 19(1)(g) of the constitution. since the act 949 empowers the fixation of a wage which may disable or destroy the industry it cannot be said to be reasonable and as such is beyond the purview of article 19(1) and (6) of the constitution. the act does not lay down any reasonable procedure in the imposition of restrictions by fixation of minimum wage and so authorises any procedure to be adopted which may even violate the principles of natural justice. it is also alleged that the act is discriminatory in effect inasmuch as it submits some industries to its arbitrary procedure in the matter of fixation of minimum wages and leaves other industries to the more orderly and regulated procedure of the industrial disputes act. it is on these grounds that the validity of the act is impugned. the petitioners impugn the validity of the notification also for the same reasons. besides, it is urged that the notification has in effect fixed not minimum wages but fair wages and so it was essential that the capacity of the employers to bear the burden proposed to be imposed ought to have been considered. failure to consider this essential aspect of the matter has, it is urged, rendered the notification void. that in substance is the nature of the case set out by the petitioners in their present petition. the respondent has traversed all these allegations. it is urged that the validity of the act is no longer open to challenge since the question is concluded by the decisions of this court; and it is alleged that what the notification purports to do is to fix the minimum wage and no more and as such the capacity of the employer to pay such a minimum wage is irrelevant. it is further alleged that decisions of this court have firmly established the principle that in the matter of fixing minimum wages the capacity of the employer to pay need not be considered and that if any employer is unable to pay what can be regarded as minimum wages to his employees he has no right to carry on his industry. it is further pointed out that out of 18 factories in feroke only six factories have come to this court and it is suggested that the grievance made by the petitioners that the wage rates fixed are 950 beyond their capacity is not genuine or honest. the respondent also points out that the committee appointed by it was a representative committee and its report showed that it had considered the matter very carefully. alternatively it is urged that the report of the said committee would show that the capacity to pay had not been ignored by the committee. the impact of the minimum wage, rate suggested by it had been considered by the committee and so the committee made its recommendations area wise.", "completion": "(a) of sub section (1) of section 5 of the (act xi of 1948) (hereafter called the act), to hold enquiries and advise the government in fixing minimum rates of wages in respect of employment in the tile industry and nominated eight persons to constitute the said committee under section 9 of the act.\nthe government of kerala then considered the report and issued a notification on may 12, 1958, prescribing minimum rates of wages as specified in the schedule annexed thereto.\non that date the present petition was filed under article 32 by the nine petitioners who represent six tile factories in feroke kozhikode district, challenging the validity of the 'act as well as the validity of the notification issued by the government of kerala.\nthe petitioners allege that the minimum wage rates fixed by the notification are very much above the level of what may be properly regarded as minimum wages and it was essential that before the impugned wage rates were prescribed the employers ' capacity to pay should have been considered.\nbesides, it is urged that the notification has in effect fixed not minimum wages but fair wages and so it was essential that the capacity of the employers to bear the burden proposed to be imposed ought to have been considered.\nit is urged that the validity of the act is no longer open to challenge since the question is concluded by the decisions of this court; and it is alleged that what the notification purports to do is to fix the minimum wage and no more and as such the capacity of the employer to pay such a minimum wage is irrelevant.\nit is further alleged that decisions of this court have firmly established the principle that in the matter of fixing minimum wages the capacity of the employer to pay need not be considered and that if any employer is unable to pay what can be regarded as minimum wages to his employees he has no right to carry on his industry."}

the result of financial inability of the factories to bear the burden but was probably actuated by political motives. the respondent also put in a general plea that in fact all the factories in the kerala 'state except some of the factories in the trichur area and one of the petitioners had implemented the notification without any objection or protest; and so it was argued that there was no substance in the grievance made by the petitioners. that in brief is the nature of the contentions raised by the respondent in reply to the petitioner 's case. at this stage it would be relevant to refer briefly to the committee 's report in the order to find out how the committee proceeded to discharge its task and what is the nature of its recommendations. the committee consisted of eight members three of whom were the employers ' representatives and three the employees ' representatives while the chairman mr. v. r. pillai and mr. g. s.pillai, the district labour officer, were nominated on the committee as independent members. the chairman mr. pillai is a m.a., m. sc. in economics of the london university. he is a professor of economics in the university college at trivandrum and has had considerable experience inasmuch as he has served on several such committees in the past. the committee issued a questionnaire to all the tile factories in the state and other persons interested, considered the replies received from them, personally visited certain factories, recorded evidence of various associations representing the 951 tile factories as well as of individuals, and took into account various facts which the committee thought were relevant. the report of the committee shows that, subject to minor differences disclosed in the minute of dissent filed by mr. k. subramonia iyer and the reply to it filed by mr. a. karunakaran, the recommendations of the committee were unanimous and so prima facie we start with the fact that the recommendations of the committee were approved not only by the two independent members but they secured the concurrence of the representatives of the employers as well as the employees. the report of the committee consists of five chapters. chapter 1 deals with the development of the tile industry in kerala, chapter 11 deals with the problem of standardisation in the tile industry, chapter iii considers the problem of wage structure area wise, chapter iv discusses the problem of minimum wage fixation, its principles and procedure, and chapter v records the conclusions and recommendations of the committee. in dealing with the problem of wage structure the committee has observed that the prevailing wage rates in the tile factories in the state show considerable difference from one centre to another, and that, according to the committee, is partly due to historical factors and partly to the economic status of the workers in the areas concerned. the committee formed the opinion that there being very little scope for alternative employment except in low paid agricultural occupations the bargaining position of the workers has all along been very weak and wages too have tended to remain at a relatively low level. it is in the light of this background that the committee naturally proceeded to consider the problem of the fixation of minimum wage rates. the committee has accepted the observation of the fair wages committee that the minimum wage \"must provide not merely for the bare subsistence of life but for the preservation of the efficiency of the workers. \" then it examined the food requirements of the employee on the basis of three consumption units recognized in dr. aykroyd 's formula. it then adopted 952 the assessment made by the planning commission in regard to the requirements of the employees in cotton textiles and placed the employee 's requirement at a per capita consumption of 18 yards per unit, then it took into account the requirement of housing and it held that the additional requirements of workers for fuel, lighting and additional miscellaneous items of expenditure should generally be fixed at 20% of the total wage in cases where the actual percentage has not been found out by a family budget enquiry. the committee was conscious that it had to approach the problem from the point of view of the minimum needs of workers in order to maintain a subsistence standard, and so it enumerated the requirements of workers in that behalf as food, clothing, fuel, lighting and other miscellaneous items in which are also included rent, education, medical aid and entertainment. on this basis the committee formulated the weekly food budget of the employee, added to it the requirement of clothing and miscellaneous items. according to the committee the total weekly expen diture on this basis would be food 13.03, clothing 1.15 and miscellaneous 2.84, the total being rs. 17.02 np. the committee then observed \"calculating on the basis of six days per week a worker should get a minimum of rs. 2.67 np. per day to maintain a 'subsistence plus ' standard.\" ultimately the committee recommended that the minimum basic wage of an unskilled worker in the \"a\" region, viz., quilon and feroke, should be re. 1. with a cost of living index for the tile centers at an average figure of 400, and the minimum requirements of the workers at rs. 2.67 np. this basic wage corresponds to 150 in the cost of living index number.", "completion": "the committee consisted of eight members three of whom were the employers '

it is the validity of this notification that is impugned before us by the present petition. before dealing with the points raised by mr. nambiar on behalf of the petitioners it is necessary to refer very briefly to the material provisions of the act. this act was passed in 1948, because it was thought expedient to provide for fixing minimum rates of wages in certain employments. under section 3 the appropriate government is empowered to fix mini. mum rates of wages in regard to employments as therein specified, and review the same at such intervals as specified by section 3(1). section 3(3) contemplates that in fixing or refixing minimum rates of wages different minimum rates of wages may be fixed for different scheduled employments, different classes of work in the same scheduled employments, adults, 120 954 adolescents, children and apprentices, and different localities. under section 4 any minimum rate of wages fixed or revised may, inter alia, consist of a basic rate of wages and a special allowance at a rate to be adjusted, or a basic rate of wages with or without the cost of living allowance and the cash value of the concessions in respect of supplies of essential commodities at concession rates where so authorised or an all inclusive rate allowing for the basic rate, the cost of living allowance and the cash value of the concessions if any. section 5 prescribes the procedure for fixing and revising minimum wages. it is under this section that a committee was appointed by the respondent in the present case. section 9 makes provision for the composition of the committee. such committees have to consist of equal number of representatives of employers and employees and of independent persons not exceeding. one third of the total number of members. section 12(1) imposes on the employer the obligation to pay the minimum rates of wages prescribed under the act. section 22 provides for penalties for offences and section 22a makes a general provision for punishment of offences not otherwise expressly provided for. under section 25 any contract or agreement whether made before or after the commencement of this act which affects an employee 's right to a minimum rate of wages prescribed under the act shall be null and void so far as it purports to reduce the said minimum rate of wages. section 27 empowers the appropriate government, after giving notification as prescribed, to add to either part of the schedule any employment in respect of which it is of opinion that minimum rates should be fixed, and thereupon the schedule shall be deemed to be amended accordingly in regard to that state. in the case of the edward mills co. ltd., beawar & ors. vs the state of ajmer (1), the validity of section 27 of the act was challenged on the ground of excessive delegation. it was urged that the act prescribed no principles and laid down no standard which could furnish an intelligent guidance to the administrative (1) ; 955 authority in making selection while acting under section 27 and so the matter was left entirely to the discretion of the appropriate government which can amend the schedule in any way it liked and such delegation virtually amounted to a surrender by the legislature of its essential legislative function. this contention was rejected by mukherjea, j., is he then was, who spoke for the court. the learned judge observed that the legislature undoubtedly intended to apply the act to those industries only where by reason of un organised labour or want of proper arrangements for effective regulation of wages or for other causes the wages of labourers in a particular industry were very low.", "completion": "as to dearness allowance the committee recommended that it should be related to the cost of living index and that the dearness allowance should be fixed at the rate of 1 np.\nin regard to dearness allowance the notification provides that a flat rate of dearness allowance for all workers irrespective of sex or grade shall be paid at the rate of one naya paisa for every two points in the cost of living index in each year in excess of rs.\nsection 3(3) contemplates that in fixing or refixing minimum rates of wages different minimum rates of wages may be fixed for different scheduled employments, different classes of work in the same scheduled employments, adults, 120 954 adolescents, children and apprentices, and different localities.\nunder section 4 any minimum rate of wages fixed or revised may, inter alia, consist of a basic rate of wages and a special allowance at a rate to be adjusted, or a basic rate of wages with or without the cost of living allowance and the cash value of the concessions in respect of supplies of essential commodities at concession rates where so authorised or an all inclusive rate allowing for the basic rate, the cost of living allowance and the cash value of the concessions if any.\nsection 12(1) imposes on the employer the obligation to pay the minimum rates of wages prescribed under the act.\nunder section 25 any contract or agreement whether made before or after the commencement of this act which affects an employee 's right to a minimum rate of wages prescribed under the act shall be null and void so far as it purports to reduce the said minimum rate of wages.\nsection 27 empowers the appropriate government, after giving notification as prescribed, to add to either part of the schedule any employment in respect of which it is of opinion that minimum rates should be fixed, and thereupon the schedule shall be deemed to be amended accordingly in regard to that state."}

(6) of article 19. in repelling the argument of the employers ' inability to meet the burden of the minimum wage rates it was observed that \"the employers cannot be heard to complain if they are compelled to pay minimum wages to their labourers even though the labourers on account of their poverty and helplessness are willing to work on lesser wages, and that if individual employers might find it difficult to carry on business on the basis of minimum wages fixed under the act that cannot be the reason for striking down the law itself as unreasonable. the inability of the employers may in many cases be due entirely to the economic conditions of those employers. \" it would thus be seen that these two decisions have firmly established the validity of the act, and there can no longer be any doubt that in fixing the minimum wage rates as contemplated by the act the hardship caused to individual employers or their inability to meet the burden has no relevance. incidentally, it may be pointed out that in dealing with the minimum wage rate,,; intended to be pre scribed by the act mukherjea, j., has in one place observed that the labourers should be secured adequate living wages. in the context it is clear that the learned judge was not referring to living wages properly so called but to the minimum wages with which alone the act is concerned. in view of these two decisions we have not allowed mr. nambiar to raise any contentions against the validity of the act. it is true that mr. nambiar attempted to argue that certain aspects of the matter on which he wished to rely had not been duly considered by the court in bijay cotton mills ltd. 's case (1). in our opinion it is futile to attempt to reopen an issue which is clearly concluded by the decisions of this court. therefore, we will proceed to deal with the present petition, as we must, on the basis that the act under which the committee \" as appointed and the notification was ultimately issued is valid. we have already seen what the act purports to achieve is to prevent exploitation of labour and for (1) ; 957 that purpose authorises the appropriate government to take steps to prescribe minimum rates of wages in the scheduled industries. in an under developed country which faces the problem of unemployment on a very large scale it is not unlikely that labour may offer to work even on starvation wages. the policy of the act is to prevent the employment of such sweated labour in the interest of general public and so in prescribing the minimum wage rates the capacity of the employer need not be considered. what is being prescribed is minimum wage rates which a welfare state assumes every employer must pay before he employs labour. this principle is not disputed (vide: messrs. crown aluminium works vs their workmen(1) it is, therefore, necessary to consider what are the components of a minimum wage in the context of the act. the evidence led before the committee on fair wages showed that some witnesses were inclined to take the view that the minimum wage is that wage which is essential to cover the bare physical needs of a worker and his family, whereas the overwhelming majority of witnesses agreed that a minimum wage should also provide for some other essential requirements such as a minimum of education, medical facilities and other amenities. the committee came to the conclusion that a minimum wage must provide not merely for the bare subsistence of life but for the preservation of the efficiency of the worker, and so it must also provide for some measure of education, medical requirements and amenities. the concept about the components of the minimum wage thus enunciated by the committee have been generally accepted by industrial adjudication in this country.", "completion": "in repelling the argument of the employers ' inability to meet the burden of the minimum wage rates it was observed that \"the employers cannot be heard to complain if they are compelled to pay minimum wages to their labourers even though the labourers on account of their poverty and helplessness are willing to work on lesser wages, and that if individual employers might find it difficult to carry on business on the basis of minimum wages fixed under the act that cannot be the reason for striking down the law itself as unreasonable.\n\" it would thus be seen that these two decisions have firmly established the validity of the act, and there can no longer be any doubt that in fixing the minimum wage rates as contemplated by the act the hardship caused to individual employers or their inability to meet the burden has no relevance.\nincidentally, it may be pointed out that in dealing with the minimum wage rate,,; intended to be pre scribed by the act mukherjea, j., has in one place observed that the labourers should be secured adequate living wages.\nwe have already seen what the act purports to achieve is to prevent exploitation of labour and for (1) ; 957 that purpose authorises the appropriate government to take steps to prescribe minimum rates of wages in the scheduled industries.\nthe policy of the act is to prevent the employment of such sweated labour in the interest of general public and so in prescribing the minimum wage rates the capacity of the employer need not be considered."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: sometimes the minimum wage is described as a bare minimum wage in order to distinguish it from the, wage structure which is 'subsistence plus or fair wage, but too much emphasis on the adjective \"bare\" in relation to the minimum wage is apt to lead to the erroneous assumption that the maintenance wage is a wage which enables the worker to cover his bare (1) ; 958 physical needs and ]keep himself just above starvation. that clearly is not intended by the concept of minimum wage. on the other hand, since the capacity of the employer to pay is treated as irrelevant, it is but right that no addition should be made to the com ponents of the minimum wage which would take the minimum wage near the lower level of the fair wage, but the contents of this concept must ensure for the employee not only his sustenance and that of his family but must also preserve his efficiency as a worker. the act contemplates that minimum wage rates should be fixed in the scheduled industries with the dual object of providing sustenance and maintenance of the worker and his family and preserving his efficiency as a worker. mr. nambiar contends that when the statute purports to prescribe a minimum wage in effect it directs the fixation of a statutory minimum wage and as such, capacity to pay must be considered before such minimum wage is fixed. his argument is that in any event the impugned notification statutorily prescribes such minimum wage rates for the tile industry in the state of kerala and as such the rates so recommended do not constitute merely the industrial and economic minimum as understood by industrial adjudication but it constitutes a statutory minimum which can be fixed only after taking into account the employers ' capacity to pay the same. in support of this argument mr. nambiar has strongly relied on some observations made by this court in the case of express newspapers (private) ltd. vs the union of india (1). we will presently refer to the said observations but in appreciating the nature and effect of the said observations it is necessary to recall that in that case the court was dealing with the problem of fixation of wages in regard to working journalists as prescribed by section 9 of the working journalists (conditions of service) and miscellaneous provisions act, 1955 (45 of 1955). section 9 of the said act required that in fixing rates of wages in respect of working journalists the board had to have regard to the cost of living, the prevalent (1) 959 rates of wages for comparable employments, the circumstances relating, to newspaper industry in different regions of the country and to any other circumstance which to the board may deem relevant. it was held that the wage structure contemplated by section 9 was not the structure of minimum wage rates, it was a wage structure permitted to be prescribed by that statute after taking into account several relevant facts and the scheme of that act showed that the wage structure thus contemplated was very much beyond the minimum wage rates and was nearer the concept of a fair wage. that is why the court took the view that the expression \"any other circumstance\" specified by section 9 definitely included the circumstance, namely, the capacity of the industry to bear the burden and so the board was bound to take that factor into account in fixing the wage structure. it appeared to the court that this important element had not been considered by the board at all and that introduced a fatal infirmity in the decisions of the board. thus, the wage structure with which the court was concerned in that case was not the mini. mum wage structure at all. it is essential to remember this aspect of the matter in appreciating the argument urged by mr. nambiar on the strength of certain observations made by this court in the course of its judgment. in the course of his judgment bhagwati, j., who spoke for the court, has elaborately considered several aspects of the concept of wage structure including the concept of minimum wage. the conclusion of the fair wage committee as to the content of the minimum wage has been cited with approval (p. 83). then a distinction has been drawn between a bare subsistence or minimum wage and a statutory minimum wage, and it is observed that the statutory minimum wage is the minimum which is prescribed by the statute and it may be higher than the bare subsistence or minimum wage providing for some measure of education, medical requirements and amenities (p. 84). this observation is followed by a discussion about the concept of fair wage; and in 960 dealing with the said topic the has also been referred to and it is stated that the act was intended to provide for fixing minimum rates of wages in certain employments and the appropriate government was thereby empowered to fix different minimum rates of wages as contemplated by section 3(3). then it is stated that whereas the bare minimum or subsistence wage would have to be fixed irrespective of the capacity of the industry to pay the minimum wage thus contemplated postulates the capacity of the industry to pay and no fixation of wages which ignores this essential factor of the capacity of the industry to pay could ever be supported. mr. nambiar contends that the last part of the observation refers to the minimum wage prescribed by the act and it requires that before prescribing the said wage the capacity of the industry must be considered.", "completion": "nambiar contends that when the statute purports to prescribe a minimum wage in effect it directs the fixation of a statutory minimum wage and as such, capacity to pay must be considered before such minimum wage is fixed.\nhis argument is that in any event the impugned notification statutorily prescribes such minimum wage rates for the tile industry in the state of kerala and as such the rates so recommended do not constitute merely the industrial and economic minimum as understood by industrial adjudication but it constitutes a statutory minimum which can be fixed only after taking into account the employers ' capacity to pay the same.\nit was held that the wage structure contemplated by section 9 was not the structure of minimum wage rates, it was a wage structure permitted to be prescribed by that statute after taking into account several relevant facts and the scheme of that act showed that the wage structure thus contemplated was very much beyond the minimum wage rates and was nearer the concept of a fair wage.\nthis observation is followed by a discussion about the concept of fair wage;

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: we do not think that this argument is well founded. it would be noticed that in considering the distinction drawn between the minimum wage fixed by industrial adjudication and the minimum wage prescribed by a statute which is called statutory minimum it has been made clear that the latter can be higher than the bare subsistence or minimum wage and as such is different in kind from the industrial minimum wage. we do not think that the observation in question was intended to lay down the principle that whereas a minimum wage can be laid down by an industrial adjudication without reference to an employer 's capacity to pay the same it cannot be fixed by a statute without considering the employer 's capacity to pay. such a conclusion would be plainly illogical and unreasonable. the observations on which mr. nambiar relies do not support the assumption made by him and were not intended to lay down any such rule. cases are not unknown where statutes prescribe a minimum and it is plain from the relevant statutory provisions themselves that the minimum thus prescribed is not the economic or industrial minimum but contains several components which take the statutorily prescribed minimum near the level of the fair wage,and when that is the effect of the statutory provision capacity to pay may no doubt have to be 961 considered. it was a statutory wage structure of this kind with which the court was dealing in the case of express newspapers (private) ltd. (1), because section 9 authorised the imposition of a wage structure very much above the level of the minimum wage and it is obvious that the observations made in the judgment cannot, and should not, be divorced from the context of the provisions with respect to which it was pronounced. therefore, we feel no hesitation in reject ing the argument that because the act prescribes minimum wage rates it is necessary that the capacity of the employer to bear the burden of the said wage structure must be considered. the attack against the validity of the notification made on this ground must therefore fail. it still remains to consider whether in fact the noti. fication has prescribed a wage structure which is above the level of the minimum wage properly socalled. if the notification has in fact prescribed a wage structure which is nearer the fair wage level and is above the minimum wage structure that no doubt would introduce an infirmity in the notification since it does appear that the capacity of the employer to bear the burden has not been considered either by the committee or by the government. this part of the attack against the notification is based on two grounds. mr. nambiar contends that in making its calculations about the minimum wage rates the committee has taken into account an item of entertainment, and that, says mr. nambiar, is clearly inadmissible. he also points out that the committee has described the daily minimum of rs. 2.67 np. ultimately deduced by it as intended to maintain the employee 's subsistence plus ' standard and that again shows that the wage structure is above the minimum, standard and goes towards the lower level of the fair wage. we are not impressed by this argument. it would be recalled that amongst the miscellaneous items in respect of which rs. 2.84 np. are added by the committee in its calculations are rent, education, (1) 121 962 medical aid and entertainment. the first three are not inadmissible, and so the attack is against the inclusion of the last item alone. even assuming that the last item is inadmissible it is not difficult to imagine that the addition of this last item could not have meant much in the calculations of the committee, and so the grievance made on account of the inclusion of the said item cannot be exaggerated. there are, however, two other factors which are relevant in this connection. what the committee has described as the subsistence plus ' standard should on its own calculations represent the daily minimum of rs. 2.84 np., not rs. 2.67 np. rs. 2.67 np. is plainly the result of miscalculation so that it can be safely assumed that the said sum which is taken to represent the daily minimum to maintain a 'subsistence plus ' standard in fact does not include an amount which may be attributed to entertainment. besides, it is necessary to remember that what the committee has ultimately recommended is not the award of rs. 2.67 np. which according to it represents 'subsistence. plus ' standard but only rs. 2 and that itself shows that what is re. commended is below the 'subsistence plus ' standard. there is yet another point which leads to the same conclusion. even if the whole of the miscellaneous item is excluded and calculations are made on the basis that the total permissible items amount to rs. 14.18 np. we would still reach the figure for the daily minimum which is more than rs. 2. therefore, look at it how we may, it is impossible to accept the argument that the wage structure ultimately recommended by the committee is anything higher than what the committee thought to be the minimum wage structure. therefore, we are not prepared to hold that the notification which is in conformity with the recommendations of the committee has prescribed wage rates which are higher than the minimum wage structure. if that be so, failure to take into account the capacity of the industry to bear the burden can introduce no infirmity either in the recommendations of ' the committee or in the notification following upon them. 963 mr.", "completion": "cases are not unknown where statutes prescribe a minimum and it is plain from the relevant

the wage structure ultimately recommended by the committee is anything higher than what the committee thought to be the minimum wage structure.\ntherefore, we are not prepared to hold that the notification which is in conformity with the recommendations of the committee has prescribed wage rates which are higher than the minimum wage structure."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: nambiar no doubt wanted to attack the merits of the notification on the ground that the wage rates fixed by it are unduly high. in that connection he relied on the fact that the minimum wage rates prescribed by the madras government by its notification published on february 25, 1952, as well as the wage rates prevailing in other industries in kerala were slightly lower. he also pointed out that the wage rates awarded by industrial adjudication and even the claims made by the employees themselves would tend to show that what has been awarded by the notification is higher than the prescribed minimum wages. it is not possible for us to entertain this contention. the determination of minimum wages must inevitably take into account several relevant factors and the decision of this question has been left by the legislature to the committee which has to be appointed under the act. we have already referred to the composition of the committee and have reviewed very briefly its report. when a committee consisting of the representatives of the industry and the employees considers the problem and makes its recommendations and when the said recommendations are accepted by the government it would ordinarily not be possible for us to examine the merits of the recommendations as well as the merits of the wage structure finally notified by the government. the notification has accepted the recommendations of the committee to categorise the workers and that obviously was overdue. the fact that wages paid in other industries in kerala, or in other states in comparable concerns, are lower would have been relevant for the com mittee to consider when it made its recommendations. in appreciating the effect of the prevalence of lower rates it may also be relevant to bear in mind that in some places and in some industries labour is still employed on wages much below the standard of minimum rates. in fact, in its report the committee has pointed out that in kerala. the bargaining position of the workers has all along been very weak and wages have tended to remain in a deplorably low level. therefore, the fact that lower wages are paid in other 964 industries or in some other places may not necessarily show that the rates prescribed by the notification are unduly high. in any event these are considerations which ordinarily cannot be entertained by us because obviously we are not sitting in appeal over the recommendations of the committee or the notification following upon them. that is why the grievance made by mr. nambiar on the merits of the wage structure prescribed by the notification cannot succeed. there is, however, one aspect of this problem to which we must refer before we part with this case. it appears that soon after the notification was issued as many as 62 tile factories in trichur closed their works and that led to unemployment of nearly 6,000 employees. in order to resolve the deadlock thus created the respondent referred the industrial dispute arising between the trichur factories and their employees for industrial adjudication (i.d. 45 of 1958). on this reference an interim award was made and it was followed by a final award on september 26, 1960. both the interim and the final awards were the result of settlement between the parties and the order passed by the tribunal shows that the respondent, acting, through its labour minister, \"left aside the prestige of the government, came to the scene and effected a settlement.\" mr. nambiar has strongly criticised the conduct of the respondent in permitting a departure from the notification in respect of 62 tile factories at trichur contrary to the provisions of the act, and in insisting upon its implementation in respect of the other parts of the state. his argument is two fold. he suggests that the settlement reached between the parties in trichur shows that the minimum prescribed by the notification was above the legally permissible minimum and beyond the capacity of the trichur factories, and that would support his grievance that the rates prescribed are not the minimum but they are such above that level. we are not im pressed by this argument. as we have already observed we would ordinarily refuse to consider the merits of the wage structure prescribed by the notification. besides, the closure of the factories in trichur may 965 either be because the factories there found it difficult to pay the wage structure or may be for reasons other than industrial. we propose to express no opinion on that point because that is not a point in issue before us, and so the settlement can have no bearing on the fate of the present petition; but the other argument urged by mr. nambiar raises a serious question. under the act the notification has to apply to all the tile factories in the state and breach of the provisions of the notification is rendered penal under section 22 of the act. an agreement or contract contrary to the notification would be void under section 25 of the act. it is to be regretted that the respondent, acting through its labour minister, appears to have assisted in bringing about a settlement contrary to the terms of the act. if the respon dent thought that such a settlement was necessary in respect of trichur factories it may consider the question of withdrawing the notification in respect of that area and in fairness may also reconsider the problem in respect of all the other areas and decide whether any modification. in the notification is required.", "completion": "in that connection he relied on the fact that the minimum wage rates prescribed by the madras government by its notification published on february 25, 1952, as well as the wage rates prevailing in other industries in kerala were slightly lower.\nhe also pointed out that the wage rates awarded by industrial adjudication and even the claims made by the employees themselves would tend to show that what has been awarded by the notification is higher than the prescribed minimum wages.\nwhen a committee consisting of the representatives of the industry and the employees considers the problem and makes its recommendations and when the said recommendations are accepted by the government it would ordinarily not be possible for us to examine the merits of the recommendations as well as the merits of the wage structure finally notified by the government.\ntherefore, the fact that lower wages are paid in other 964 industries or in some other places may not necessarily show that the rates prescribed by the notification are unduly high.\nnambiar on the merits of the wage structure prescribed by the notification cannot succeed.\nhe suggests that the settlement reached between the parties in trichur shows that the minimum prescribed by the notification was above the legally permissible minimum and beyond the capacity of the trichur factories, and that would support his grievance that the rates prescribed are not the minimum but they are such above that level."}

but the learned judges held that the sabha was entitled only to a half share in the cash and properties pertaining to the estate of the said testator, and appointed the official trustee as trustee only in regard to the said share: on that basis, suitable directions were given. the first respondent accepted that position, but the appellants, i.e., the persons claiming to be the heirs at law, preferred the present appeal against the judgment of the high court in so far as it went against them. 30 learned counsel for the appellants contends that under the will not a trust but only a charge was created in favour of the first respondent and, therefore, the first respondent could not invoke in aid the provisions of section 10 of the act. section 10 of the act reads: \"(1) if any property is subject to a trust other than a trust which the official trustee is prohibited from accepting under the provisions of this act, and there is no trustee within the local limits of the ordinary or extraordinary original civil jurisdiction of the high court willing or capable to act in the trust, the high court may on application make an order for the appointment of the official trustee by that name with his consent to be the trustee of such property. \" it is common case that if the will created a trust, it would not fall under any one of the exceptions mentioned in the section. therefore, the only question is whether the will created a trust or a charge in favour of the first respondent. the concepts of trust and charge are well defined. a trust is \"an obligation annexed to the ownership of property, and arising out of a confidence reposed in and accepted by the owner or declared and accepted by him, for the benefit of another, or of another and the owner. \" where property \"of one person is made security for the payment of money to another, the latter person is said to have a charge on the property. \" the boundaries between the two concepts are well demarcated; but, more often than not, courts found considerable difficulty in construing a particular document to place it in one or other of the categories. the same difficulty was encountered even in england. the test laid down for marking out the one from the other by some of the authoritative text books on the subject may be useful in construing the will in question. in halsbury 's laws of england, 2nd edn. 33 (lord hailsham), the distinction between the two concepts has been stated thus at p. 98: \"where property is given to a person upon condition that he does a certain act or confers a 31 certain benefit on another person, the condition may constitutes a trust if it is directed to be, or must necessarily be, performed and satisfied out of the property, and consequently imposes a fiduciary obliga tion in respect of the property; but it will not be construed as a trust if this is not the case and the condition merely imposes a collateral duty. similarly, a devise of land upon condition of paying a sum of money or an annuity does not create a trust, though it may create a charge.", "completion": "on march 17, 1950, the first respondent, uttarpara hitakari sabha (hereinafter referred to as the sabha) filed an application in the high court of judicature at allahabad under section 10 of the official trustees act (act ii of 1913) claiming that the late pyare mohan bannerji had created a trust by his will and praying that an official trustee be appointed to be the trustee of the properties of the trust.\nmootham, j., as he then was, who heard the said case at the first instance, held that by his last will pyare mohan bannerji created a trust in favour of the sabha, and appointed the official trustee a trustee of all the properties left by pyare mohan bannerji specified in schedule b to the petition.\nj., that the will created a trust in favour of the sabha;

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: a charge does not in itself create a trust, but it may do so if it is coupled with other trusts or the context, otherwise so requires. conversely a trust may amount merely to a charge.\" lord st. leonards points out (sugden on powers, 7th edn., p. 122) that, \"what by the old law was deemed a devise upon condition, would now, perhaps, in almost every case be construed as a devise in fee upon trust, and by this construction, instead of the heir taking advantage of the condition broken, the cestui que trust can compel an observance of the trust by suit in equity. \" in the commissioners of charitable donations and bequests vs wybrants (1) a testator had devised lands to trustees and their heirs upon trust to grant and convey the same to the use of john wybrants for life 'subject nevertheless to and charged and chargeable with ' four annuities, three of which were to be paid to charitable institutions and the fourth to the poor of a parish. in construing that provision, the lord chancellor said at p. 285: \"it certainly is not necessary to use the word 'trust ' in order to create an express trust. i do not intend to lay it down that every charge creates a trust, although it imposes a burden; but a charge may create a trust; depending on the nature of the charge. in bailey vs ekins (2) lord elton said he was confident lord thurlow 's opinion was that a charge (of debts) is a devise of the estate, in substance and effect, pro tanto upon trust to pay the (1) (1845) 69 r.r. 278. (2) , 323. 32 debts:and this is supported by the current of authorities. the principle is no less powerful in the case of charities, particularly where the charity is to a fluctuating, uncertain body, like the poor of a parish. the testator gives the estate to one, subject to this charge. who is to pay the annuities but the person who is liable to the burden: and this, in the case of a charity, impresses him with the character of a trustee for the charity. by the ancient rule of equity, no one could acquire an estate, with notice of a charitable use, without being liable to it. \" the fact that a beneficial interest is also created in favour of the trustees in respect of the property subject to a trust does not make the transaction any the less a trust. the law permits a person to bequeath his property to another subject to a trust in respect of a portion of the income in favour of a third party or a charity. on this subject in lewin on trusts, it is stated at p. 133: \"upon this subject a distinction must be observed between a devise to a person for a particular purpose with no intention of conferring the beneficial interest, and a devise with the view of conferring the beneficial interest, but subject to a particular injunction. \" so too, tudor in his book on charities, 5th edn., says much to the same effect at p. 52: \"a charitable trust may be made to attach to a part of the property only, or it may be limited to particular payments directed to be made out of the income, as in the numerous cases where property has been given to a college, or municipal corporation, or city guild, upon trust or to the intent that certain specified charitable payments shall be made or subject to or charged with certain charitable payments. in these cases, as will be seen, the donees as a rule take beneficially, subject only to the specified charitable payments. \" the said tests may afford a guide to ascertain whether a document creates a charge or a trust; but they are subject to the fundamental rule of construction that a trust may be created in language sufficient 33 to show the intention, and no technical words are necessary; the said intention must be gathered from a fair reading of the provisions of the document. in the light of the foregoing discussion, let us look at the provisions of the will to ascertain the express intention of the testator. at the time the testator executed the will he had a wife, and a nephew by name sital prasad chatterji, but no children. he had many other close relatives and dependents. he was also charitably disposed. he executed the will making suitable provision for his wife, nephew, relatives and for charities. he could carry out his intention in two ways: he could bequeath his entire property to his widow and nephew subject to a fiduciary obligation imposed on them to pay certain amounts to the relatives and the charities; or, he could give the entire property to his widow and nephew subject to the payment of certain amounts charged on the said property. the question is, what did he intend to do by this document? he did not use either the word \"trust\" or \"charge\" and, therefore, we must gather the intention only from the circumstances obtaining at the time the document was executed and the recitals found therein. under the will the testator made the following bequests depending upon different contingencies: firstly, the property was given to his wife and nephew in equal shares for their lifetime subject to the payment of all his debts, annuities and charges; it is also provided therein for the sale of a standing jungle in doomree and sukhiae in the gorakhpore district for the purpose of discharging the debts.", "completion": "\" in the commissioners of charitable donations and bequests vs wybrants (1) a testator had devised lands to trustees and their heirs upon trust to grant and convey the same to the use of john wybrants for life 'subject nevertheless to and charged and chargeable with ' four annuities, three of which were to be paid to charitable institutions and the fourth to the poor of a parish.\n52: \"a charitable trust may be made to attach to a part of the property only, or it may be limited to particular payments directed to be made out of the income, as in the numerous cases where property has been given to a college, or municipal corporation, or city guild, upon trust or to the intent that certain specified charitable payments shall be made or subject to or charged with certain charitable payments.\n\" the said tests may afford a guide to ascertain whether a document creates a charge or a trust; but they are subject to the fundamental rule of construction that a trust may be created in language sufficient 33 to show the intention, and no technical words are necessary; the said intention must be gathered from a fair reading of the provisions of the document.\nhe could carry out his intention in two ways: he could bequeath his entire property to his widow and nephew subject to a fiduciary obligation imposed on them to pay certain amounts to the relatives and the charities; or, he could give the entire property to his widow and nephew subject to the payment of certain amounts charged on the said property.\nhe did not use either the word \"trust\" or \"charge\" and, therefore, we must gather the intention only from the circumstances obtaining at the time the document was executed and the recitals found therein.\nunder the will the testator made the following bequests depending upon different contingencies: firstly, the property was given to his wife and nephew in equal shares for their lifetime subject to the payment of all his debts, annuities and charges; it is also provided therein for the sale of a standing jungle in doomree and sukhiae in the gorakhpore district for the purpose of discharging the debts."}

(d) of section 58 of the 1952 act corresponds to cl. (bb) of section 30 of the 1923 act, it has to be noticed that the requirement in the 1952 40 act is wider. for, whereas rules under section 30(bb) could require the maintenance of creches and could prescribe certain matters in regard to these, only in mines, wherein \"any women are ordinarily employed\", section 58(d) authorises the framing of similar rules for maintenance of creches and prescription of similar matters, in respect of all mines, \"wherein any women are employed or were employed on any day of the preceding twelve months\". it is contended on behalf of the appellants that the creche rules, 1946, framed as they were under section 30(bb) of the 1923 act, must be read as requiring the maintenance of creches and prescribing certain matters relating to creches, only for mines \"wherein any women are ordinarily employed\". they cannot therefore be considered to be rules under section 58(d) of the 1952 act, which have to require the maintenance of creches, and prescribe matters relating thereto, not only for mines where women are ordinarily employed, but for mines \"wherein any women are employed or were employed on any day of the preceding twelve months\". it is urged that the content of the rules cannot be extended by the fact that the 1952 act permits rules to be framed in respect of mines other than those in respect of which the rules were originally framed.", "completion": "this appeal on a certificate granted by the high court of calcutta under article 134(1)(c) of the constitution is against a judgment and order of that court, upholding the conviction of these appellants under section 73 of the indian , for contravention of rule 7 of the mines creche rules, 1946.\nthe main contentions raised on behalf of the appellants are, (1) that the mines creche rules, 1946, had stood repealed, along with the repeal by section 88 of the of 1952, of the mines act, 1923,.\nunder which these rules were admittedly framed and, (2) they having 39 been framed under section 30 (bb) of the mines act, 1923, cannot be deemed to be rules made under the , as.\nthe same reasons which form the basis of that decision apply to the rules framed under section 30 of the mines act, 1923; and so, the first contention raised on behalf of the appellants must be rejected as unsound.\nclause (bb) of section 30 of the 1923 act mentions one of the purposes for which rules may be made in these words \"for requiring the maintenance in mines, wherein any women are ordinarily employed, of suitable rooms to be reserved for the use of the children under the age of 6 years belonging to such women, and for prescribing, either generally or with particular reference to number of women ordinarily employed in the mine, the number and standards of such rooms, and the nature and extent of the supervision to be provided therein.\nfor, whereas rules under section 30(bb) could require the maintenance of creches and could prescribe certain matters in regard to these, only in mines, wherein \"any women are ordinarily employed\", section 58(d) authorises the framing of similar rules for maintenance of creches and prescription of similar matters, in respect of all mines, \"wherein any women are employed or were employed on any day of the preceding twelve months\".\nit is contended on behalf of the appellants that the creche rules, 1946, framed as they were under section 30(bb) of the 1923 act, must be read as requiring the maintenance of creches and prescribing certain matters relating to creches, only for mines \"wherein any women are ordinarily employed\".\nthey cannot therefore be considered to be rules under section 58(d) of the 1952 act, which have to require the maintenance of creches, and prescribe matters relating thereto, not only for mines where women are ordinarily employed, but for mines \"wherein any women are employed or were employed on any day of the preceding twelve months\"."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: in our opinion, the argument is not without force, and it might be difficult to say that, the mines creche rules framed under section 30(bb) of the 1923 act, would apply to all mines contemplated by section 58(d) of the 1952 act. this difficulty would not however stand in the way of the mines creche rules, 1946, operating in respect of \"mines where women are ordinarily employed\", as rules under the 1952 act. it has to be noticed that the mines in respect of which rules may be made under section 58(d) of the 1952 act, do not exclude mines, where women are ordinarily employed; the description \"mine wherein any women are ordinarily employed \"include, in the first place the mines where women are ordinarily employed and include in addition to those other mines\", 'wherein any women are employed or were employed on any day of the preceding twelve months ', even though the attribute of \"women being ordinarily 41 employed there\", is not present. assuming therefore as correct the argument that the content of the rules does not stand extended, the mines creche rules, 1946, may still be reasonably deemed to be rules under section 58(d) of the 1952 act, though not fully exhausting the purpose mentioned in that section. in other words, the position is that while under section 58(d) of the 1952 act rules may be framed in respect of (1) mines wherein women are ordinarily employed and (2) mines wherein though women are not ordinarily employed, women are employed and (3) mines, where though women are not ordinarily employed, women were employed on any day of the preceding twelve months, the mines creche rules, 1946, cover a part of the ground that could be covered by rules under section 58(d) of the 1952 act. to the extent the provisions of section 58(d) of the 1950 act and section 30(bb) of the earlier enactment overlap, these rules would continue in force by virtue of section 24 of the . on an examination of the evidence adduced in the case before the magistrate, we find that the jawabad mine was one, where women were ordinarily employed. with regard to this mine therefore the mines creche rules operated as rules under the 1952 act; and consequently, contravention of rule 7 of the mines creche rules, 1946, was in law a contravention of a rule made under the 1952 act, within the meaning of section 73 of that act. on behalf of the second appellant, gupta, who was the manager of the colliery at the relevant time, a further contention is raised. it is pointed out that rule 7(1) does not in terms lay any duty on the manager and it is contended that the manager having no duty to perform under rule 7(1) of the creche rules; no question of his contravening the same by omission to appoint a creche in charge arises. the answer to this question depends on the interpretation of section 18 of the , which is in these words: \"18. duties and responsibilities of owners, agents and managers: 6 42 (1) the owner, agent and manager of every mine shall be responsible that all operations carried on in connection therewith are conducted in accordance with the provisions of this act and of the regulations, rules and bye laws and of any orders made thereunder. (2) in the event of any contravention of any such provisions by any person whosoever, the owner, agent and manager of the mine shall each be deemed also to be guilty of such contravention unless he proves that he had taken all reasonable means, by publishing and to the best of his power enforcing those provisions, to prevent such contravention. (3) it shall not be a defence in any proceedings brought against an owner or agent of a mine under this section that a manager of the mine has been appointed in accordance with the provisions of this act\". it has to be noticed that after the first sub section states in general terms that the owner, agent and manager shall be responsible for the carrying out of \"all operations carried on\" in connection with the mine, in accordance with the provisions of the act and of the regulations, rules and bye laws and of any orders made thereunder, the second sub section d eals with the question of guilt of the owner, the agent and manager for contravention of such provisions by \"any person whosoever\"; and the third sub section goes on to say that the owner or agent cannot escape liability merely because a manager of the mine has been appointed. the first contention urged on behalf of the appellant is that the mines creche rules have nothing to do with \"operations carried on in the mines\" and that section 18 deals only with the proper observance of the provisions of the act directly touching the work carried on in the mines, for raising coal and allied activities. in our opinion that will be an unduly narrow interpretation of the section. the employment of female labour is obviously and admittedly connected with the raising of coal in the mine; and all conditions of employment of female labour should reasonably be held to be 43 inextricably connected with \"operations carried on\" in the mines. the mines creche rules are no less conditions of female labour than are the provisions of, say, section 46 of the act.", "completion": "it has to be noticed that after the first sub section states in general terms that the owner, agent and manager shall be responsible for the carrying out of \"all operations carried on\" in connection with the mine, in accordance with the provisions of the act and of the regulations, rules and bye laws and of any orders made thereunder, the second sub section d eals with the question of guilt of the owner, the agent and manager for contravention of such provisions by \"any person whosoever\"; and the third sub section goes on to say that the owner or agent cannot escape liability merely because a manager of the mine has been appointed.\nthe first contention urged on behalf of the appellant is that the mines creche rules have nothing to do with \"operations carried on in the mines\" and that section 18 deals only with the proper observance of the provisions of the act directly touching the work carried on in the mines, for raising coal and allied activities.\nthe mines creche rules are no less conditions of female labour than are the provisions of, say, section 46 of the act."}

for the matter is put beyond doubt by section 18(2). this sub section of section 18 makes all the three the owner, the agent and the manager severally liable for the breach of any regu lations by \"any person whosoever\". not only is that person who contravened the provisions guilty but each of these three the manager, the agent and the owner is also deemed to be guilty though the contravention was not by himself. it would be illogical to say in the face of this provision that two of them should not be held liable for the contravention of the provisions within section 18(1) by the third. but, says, the manager appellant, such a construction of section 18(2) should be avoided as it will be thorough. by unjust. \"how am i to secure\", says he, \"the observance of a rule which in terms fixes a duty on the owner only to do certain things\". the argument really is that the legislature acted improperly making the owner, the agent and the manager vicariously liable for the contravention of certain provisions by \" any person whosoever\". with the wisdom of the law the court is not however concerned. it is pertinent to notice however that it was clearly to avoid injustice which may result from the fixation of such vicarious liability that the legislature has provided for a special defence of the owner, the agent and the manager in such cases. thus, if a rule or a bye law in terms lays a duty on the manager, and the owner is prosecuted he will escape punishment as soon as he shows that he did all that he could reasonably do in seeing that the manager duly performed his duty. the effect of sub section (3) is that the mere appointment of a manager would not be a sufficient defence. where, as in the present case, the rule in question lays a duty in terms on the owner and the manager is prosecuted he will escape conviction on showing that he took all reasonable 45 means to prevent the contravention of the rules by the owner. the whole purpose of section 18 read as a whole appears to be clearly this: the provisions of the act and of the regulations, rules and bye laws or orders made thereunder may require certain things to be done or forbidding the doing of certain things with or without mentioning the person required to do the thing or forbidden to do it. where a person definitely indicated is required to do or forbidden to do a certain thing he is straightaway, liable to penalty for contravention of the rules. but the owner, the agent and the manager will have the additional responsibility that even though any of them is not named as the person required or forbidden to do a thing, the owner, the manager or the agent, will be liable to punishment for the contravention of the rule, subject to this that the liability will disappear as soon as he shows that he had taken all reasonable means to prevent the contravention.", "completion": "the true position in our opinion is that in order that operations carried on in connection with the mine can be said to have been conducted in accordance with the provisions of the act, and of the regulations, rules and bye laws, and of the orders made thereunder, it is necessary not only that such provisions as are directly connected with the work of raising coal are observed, but also that provisions governing the conditions of employment of the persons engaged in the mining operations are also observed.\nin our opinion, therefore, the effect of section 18(1) is that all three the manager, the agent and the owner are responsible for the observance of the mines creche rules.\n44 on behalf of the state it is urged that the result of such a responsibility being laid on all the three is that the manager is liable to penalty for a contravention of the mines creche rules by the owner.\nthe argument really is that the legislature acted improperly making the owner, the agent and the manager vicariously liable for the contravention of certain provisions by \" any person whosoever\".\nbut the owner, the agent and the manager will have the additional responsibility that even though any of them is not named as the person required or forbidden to do a thing, the owner, the manager or the agent, will be liable to punishment for the contravention of the rule, subject to this that the liability will disappear as soon as he shows that he had taken all reasonable means to prevent the contravention."}

(1956) nag. 46 court that it was the owner alone who could be deemed to have contravened the rule and that the agent even assuming that he was the representative of the owner in respect of the management of the colliery had no duty to perform in this matter. we notice however that the attention of the learned judges was not drawn to the provisions of section 18 of the indian . this decision is therefore of no assistance. the question as regards the liability of any agent or manager of the mine for the construction of pithead baths or of mine creches appears to have been raised before the calcutta high court in g. d. bhattar vs the state (1). in that ease both the learned judges considered section 18 of the , but came to different conclusions, one of them holding that under section 18 the manager would be liable for carrying out the provisions of these rules while the other learned judge took a different view. in our opinion, the former view is correct. all the contentions raised on behalf of the appellants therefore fail. the appeal is accordingly dismissed. mudholkar, j. while i agree to the order proposed with respect to mohan lal goenka, i am of the opinion that the conviction of the co appellant gupta who was a manager of the mines cannot be sustained. it has throughout been accepted that under r. 7(1) of the mines creche rules, 1946, as they stood on the date of the alleged contravention the responsibility for appointing a creche in charge was on the owner of the mine only. it was, therefore, contended on behalf of gupta that he cannot be held liable for the contravention of the rule made by the owner mohan lal goenka. reliance was, however, placed on behalf of the state in the courts below as well as before us on the provisions of section 18 of the (35 of 1952). that section reads thus: \"(1) the owner, agent and manager of every mine shall be responsible that all operations carried on in connection therewith are conducted in accordance with the provisions of this act and of the (1) a.i.r.

at calcutta. the calcutta branch was located at 19, 103 sambhu mallick lane. on april 26, 1952, the appellant applied for a licence for importing rupees one crore worth of art silk yarn. on may 2,

of correspondence. that correspondence was returned to him on october 9, 1952. nothing happened up to march 31, 1953, on which date the appellant wrote to the chief controller of imports, new delhi, a long letter expressing his grievance at the action of the joint chief controller of imports and exports, calcutta, and requesting for a sympathetic decision. the chief controller of imports and exports, by his letter dated april 20,1953, informed the 104 appellant that the order of the joint chief controller of imports and exports could not be revised for the reasons mentioned in that letter. this letter gave the wrong number of the appellant 's firm. it mentioned its number as '16 ' instead of the correct number '19 '. in other respects the address of this letter was correct. the appellant states that he did not receive this letter. in august 1953, the appellant met kalyanam at calcutta. kalyanam told the appellant that he could get the licence validated through the good offices of one of his acquaintances, rajan by name, at delhi. both these persons came to delhi in august, 1953, and visited rajan. the appellant made over the file containing the licences to kalyanam who in his turn made over the same to rajan. two or three days later kalyanam returned the licences containing the alleged forged endorsements to the appellant. the forged endorsements related to the confirmation of the licence and its re validation till may 2, 1954. the confirmation endorsement was purported to be dated july 2, 1952, and the re validating one purported to be dated april 25, 1953. thereafter, orders were placed on the basis of the re validated licence and when the goods arrived attempt was made to clear them at madras. the clearing office at madras suspected the genuineness of the confirmation and re validating endorsements and finding the suspicion confirmed, made over the matter to the police. as a result of the investigation and preliminary enquiry, the appellant and kalyanam were committed to the high court for trial. eight charges were framed. the first charge related to the criminal conspiracy between the two accused and was as follows: \"that the said (1) purushottamdas dalmia and (2) l. n.", "completion": "this appeal, by special leave, is from the order of the calcutta high court dated may 16, 1958, summarily dismissing the appeal of the appellant

(ii) alternative conspiracies could not be charged as they must be the result of different agreements between the conspirators. (iii) the learned judge misdirected the jury in putting certain matters before it in the form he had done. the chief criticisms in this connection were that (a) the accused must have known from the ante dating of the confirmation endorsement that the re validation of the licence was a forgery; (b) even if the proper officer of the department had signed the re validation, it would still be a forgery when it was ante dated; (c) the letter of the chief controller of imports and exports dated april 20, 1953, though wrongly addressed, must have reached the appellant; (d) the learned judge expressed his opinions strongly and this could have unduly affected the mind of the jury and forced it to come to the same conclusions. the jurisdiction of the calcutta high court to try an offence of criminal conspiracy under section 120 b, indian penal code, is not disputed. it is also not disputed that the overt acts committed in pursuance of the conspiracy were committed in the course of the same transaction which embraced the conspiracy and the acts done under it. it is however contended for the appellant, in view of section 177 of the code of criminal procedure, that the court having jurisdiction to try the offence of conspiracy cannot try an offence constituted by such overt acts which are committed beyond its jurisdiction and reliance is placed on the decision in jiban banerjee vs state (1). this case undoubtedly supports the appellant 's contention. we have considered it carefully and are of opinion that it has not been rightly decided. the desirability of the trial, together, of an offence of criminal conspiracy and of all the overt acts committed in pursuance of it, is obvious. to establish the offence of criminal conspiracy, evidence of the (1) a.i.r. 1959 cal. 107 overt acts must be given by the prosecution. such evidence will be necessarily tested by cross examination on behalf of the accused. the court will have to come to a decision about the credibility of such evidence and, on the basis of such evidence, would determine, whether the offence of criminal conspiracy has been established or not. having done all this, the court could also very conveniently record a finding of 'guilty ' or 'not guilty ' with respect to the accused said to have actually committed the various overt acts.", "completion": "kalyanam along with the person or persons name or names unknown between the months of april and december one thousand nine hundred and fifty three at calcutta, howrah, delhi, madras and other places were parties to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence punishable with rigorous imprisonment for two years or upwards, to wit, an 105 offence of forgery by certificate or endorsement of confirmation and an endorsement of validation of the import trade control licence being licence no.\nthe eighth charge was against kalyanam alone and was for his abetting the appellant in his committing the offence of fraudulently and dishonestly using as genuine the customs copy of the said licence, ext.\nthe jury returned a verdict of 'guilty ' against the appellant on the charge of conspiracy under section 120 b read with section 471, indian penal code and the other charges nos.\nthe following points were raised by learned counsel for the appellant: 14 106 (i) the offences of using the forged documents as ,genuine were committed at madras and therefore the courts at calcutta had no jurisdiction to try these offences under section 471 read with section 466, indian penal code.\nthe jurisdiction of the calcutta high court to try an offence of criminal conspiracy under section 120 b, indian penal code, is not disputed.\nit is however contended for the appellant, in view of section 177 of the code of criminal procedure, that the court having jurisdiction to try the offence of conspiracy cannot try an offence constituted by such overt acts which are committed beyond its jurisdiction and reliance is placed on the decision in jiban banerjee vs state (1)."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: if some of the overt acts were committed outside the jurisdiction of the court trying the offence of criminal conspiracy and if the law be that such overt acts could not be tried by that court, it would mean that either the prosecution is forced to give up its right of prosecuting those accused for the commission of those overt acts or that both the prosecution and the accused are put to unnecessary trouble inasmuch as the prosecution will have to produce the same evidence a second time and the accused will have to test the credibility of that evidence a second time. the time of another court will be again spent a second time in determining the same question. there would be the risk of the second court coming to a different conclusion from that of the first court. it may also be possible to urge in the second court that it is not competent to come to a different conclusion in view of what has been said by this court in pritam singh vs the state of punjab (1): \"the acquittal of pritam singh lohara of that charge was tantamount to a finding that the prosecution had failed to establish the possession of the revolver exhibit p 56 by him. the possession of that revolver was a fact in issue which had to be established by the prosecution before he could be convicted of the offence with which he had been charged. that fact was found against the prosecution and having regard to the observations of lord mac dermoidal quoted above, could not be proved against pritam singh lohara. in any further proceedings between the crown and him.\" (1) a.i.r. 1956 section c. 415, 422. 108 in these circumstances, unless the provisions of the code of criminal procedure admit of no other construction than the one placed upon them by the calcutta high court, they should be construed to give jurisdiction to the court trying the offence of criminal conspiracy to try all the overt acts committed in pursuance of that conspiracy. we do not find any compelling reasons in support of the view expressed by the calcutta high court. it is true that the legislature treats with importance the jurisdiction of courts for the trial of offences. jurisdiction of courts is of two kinds. one type of jurisdiction deals with respect to the power of the courts to try particular kinds of offences. that is a jurisdiction which goes to the root of the matter and if a court not empowered to try a particular offence does try it, the entire trial is void. the other jurisdiction is what may be called territorial jurisdiction. similar importance is not attached to it. this is clear from the provisions of sections 178, 188, 197(2) and 531, criminal procedure code. section 531 provides that: \"no finding, sentence or order of any criminal court shall be set aside merely on the ground that the inquiry, trial or other proceeding in the course of which it was arrived at or passed, took place in a wrong sessions division, district, sub division or other local area, unless it appears that such error has in fact occasioned a failure of justice. \" the reason for such a difference in the result of a case being tried by a court not competent to try the offence and by a court competent to try the offence but having no territorial jurisdiction over the area where the offence was committed is understandable. the power to try offences is conferred on all courts according to the view the legislature holds with respect to the capability and responsibility of those courts. the higher the capability and the sense of responsibility, the larger is the jurisdiction of those courts over the various offences. territorial jurisdiction is provided just as a matter of convenience, keeping in mind the administrative point of view with respect to the work of a particular court, the convenience of the accused 109 who will have to meet the charge levelled againt him and the convenience of the witnesses who have to appear before the court. it is therefore that it is provided in section 177 that an offence would ordinarily be tried by a court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction it is committed. it was said in assistant sessions judge, north arcot vs ramaswami asari (1): \"the scheme of chapter xv, sub chapter (a) in which sections 177 to 189 appear, seems to me to be intended to enlarge as much as possible the ambit of the sites in which the trial of an offence might be held and to minimise as much as possible the inconvenience which would be caused to the prosecution, by the success of a technical plea that the offence was not committed within the local limits of the jurisdiction of the trying court. \" it is further significant to notice the difference in the language of section 177 and section 233. section 177 simply says that ordinarily every offence would be tried by a court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction it was committed. it does not say that it would be tried by such court except in the cases mentioned in sections 179 to 185 and 188 or in cases specially provided by any other provision of law. it leaves the place of trial open. its provisions are not peremptory. there is no reason why the provisions of sections 233 to 239 may not also provide exceptions to section 177, if they do permit the trial of a particular offence along with others in one court.", "completion": "108 in these circumstances, unless the provisions of the code of criminal procedure admit of no other construction than the one placed upon them by the calcutta high court, they should be construed to give jurisdiction to the court trying the offence of criminal conspiracy to try all the overt acts committed in pursuance of

(a) of section 239, criminal procedure code, is that the accusation against those persons should be of offences committed in the course of the same transaction. it cannot be disputed that the accusation against the accused with respect to the overt acts committed by them in pursuance of a conspiracy is with respect to offences committed in the course of the same transaction and that therefore persons accused of these offences can be tried together at one trial in pursuance of the provisions of el.

three deities were installed in the 71 temple and members of the public offered worship therein, though there was no formal dedication; and the shops were let out on rent for the upkeep of the dharmasala and temple. they allege that after the sri death of ramji das they came into possession of the properties in question but in january, 1958, the respondents, namely, the state of punjab, some of its officials ' and the municipal committee, barnala, by force and without any authority of law dispossessed them from the dharmasala in question and further deprived them of the control and management of the said dharmasala and temple and are seeking to interfere with their management and control of the shops appurtenant thereto. the municipal committee, it is stated, was put in possession of the dharmasala and has opened its office in its main room. the petitioners first asked for a copy of the orders in pursuance of which these acts were committed, but were unable to obtain the same. the petitioners then made an application under article 226 of the constitution in the punjab high court, which was rejected on the preliminary ground that the matter involved disputed questions of fact. an appeal was also dismissed on the same ground. the petitioners then filed the present petition and contend that the orders in pursuance of which the acts of dispossession have been committed as well as the acts themselves, constitute a flagrant infringement by the state and its officials of the fundamental right of the petitioners to hold and possess the properties in question unless and until they are evicted in due course of law, and accordingly they have prayed that: (i) a suitable writ, order or direction be issued quashing the illegal orders of the state government, the deputy commissioner, sangrur, and the sub divisional magistrate, sangrur, if any, culminating in the handing over of possession, management and control over the dharmasala, the temple and the shops to the municipal committee, barnala, district sangrur;

(2) the shopkeepers will arrange 'piao ' (shed for the arrangement for supplying drinking water) for the passengers and will maintain it. 73 (3) plans of the building which they want to construct should at first be presented before me (assistant surgeon in charge).

that he employed three employees one bandit for worship etc., one for looking after the travelers, and a third to keep the premises clean; that there was no order to take accounts from ramji das; and that repairs etc. were carried out from the rents of the shops. the nazim, however, said in his order that the 'sarai ' was declared to be that of the state, and presumably he said so on the ground that it stood on government land. later, ramji das 75 obtained further permission to make a raised platform and other extensions, details whereof are not necessary for our purpose. we then come to 1954. on september 10, 1954, one gopal das, secretary, congress committee, barnala, filed a petition to the revenue minister, patiala, in which various allegations were made against ramji das and it was prayed that ramji das be suspended and the management of the dharmasala etc. be taken over by the state. this petition was enquired into by the tahsildar, who again found that the dharmasala was constructed by ramji das on government land, that the dharmasala was for public benefit and that ramji das had been managing it all along. he reported, however, that ramji das was bound to render accounts and as he had failed to do so and considered the property to be his own, he should be removed and past accounts called for. the matter was then referred to the legal remembrance of the state government. this officer referred to the earlier order of the revenue minister and pointed out that the dharmasala and temple, though built on government land, were not government property and even though ramji das was repudiating the existence of a public trust, he was working as trustee of a trust created for public purposes of a charitable or religious nature and could be removed only as a result of a suit under section 92, civil procedure code. the matter appears to have rested there and no further action was taken against ramji das on the petition of gopal das.", "completion": "sometime in january, 1925, ramji das himself appears to have made a statement to the tahsildar, barnala, in which he said: \"this inn land was given to me by the govern ment by way of wakf.\non april 7, 1928, the revenue minister, patiala state, passed an order which said that though the land on which the dharmasala had been built was originally government land (nazul property), it would not be proper to declare it as such and the dharmasala should continue to exist for the benefit of the public.\nramji das will look after it in the capacity of a manager and the income accruing therefrom will be spent on the inn for the public benefit.\nand if ramji das or any other person or manager will transfer it, then any such transfer will be considered unlawful and invalid and in such an event the government will eschewer it but even then this inn will be used for the public benefit.\nagain, an enquiry was hold and it was found by the nazim, district barnala, that the dharmasala and temple were constructed by ramji das;

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: we may refer here to a somewhat earlier order of the revenue minister dated december 13, 1954, in which there was a direction that a deed of trust should be executed appointing ramji das and two other persons as trustees. no such trust deed appears to have been executed. we now come to the last part of the story. after the death of ramji das on december 10, 1957, the petitioners continued the management of the dharmasala, temple and the shops appurtenant thereto. this was not seriously disputed before us. the petitioners 76 paid the necessary taxes and electric charges for which they obtained receipts; they also realised the rent of the shops. on or about december 23, 1957, gopal das and some others describing themselves as members of the public, barnala, made an application that since ramji das was dead, new arrangements should be made for the proper management of the dharmasala which is used for the benefit of the public. this led to fresh researches into the old papers, and this time the sub divisional officer, barnala, recommended that in the interest of government (sometime before this barnala come into the punjab state) the municipal committee, barnala, should take immediate charge of the management of the dharmasala. this recommendation was affirmed by the deputy commissioner, sangrur, who wrote to the punjab government for necessary sanction of the recommendation. the sanction has not been produced before us, but learned counsel for the respondents has produced before us the letter which the deputy commissioner wrote. this letter says: \"subject:management of 'sarai ' near railway station, barnala. one shri ramji das was appointed as manager vide order of the revenue minister of the erstwhile state of patiala dated 26 12 1987bk of the property, as cited subject. the manager was only to look after the property and to utilize the income of the property for the improvement of the 'sarai ' for publi c welfare. shri ramji das, manager is reported to have died and there is none else to manage 'sarai '. the section d. o., barnala, has recommended that in the interest of the government, the management of the 'sarai ' may immediately be entrusted to the m. c., barnala. i also fully agree with the views of the section d. o., barnala, who has accordingly been directed to hand over the management to the m. c. in anticipation of approval of the government.\" in pursuance of the direction given by the deputy commissioner, the kanungo presumably in accordance 77 with the orders of the sub divisional officer, barnala, dispossessed the petitioners from part of the dharmasala on january 7, 1958, and made over charge of the same to the municipal committee, barnala. the petitioners challenge these orders as being without authority of law and complain that these orders and the acts committed in pursuance thereof, amount to a flagrant violation of their fundamental rights under articles 14, 19 and 31 of the constitution. they say that they have been deprived of property by the state and its officers in pursuance of executive orders without authority of law; they have been denied equal protection of the laws; and their fundamental right to hold property has been violated in the most arbitrary manner which is destructive of the basic principles of the rule of law guaranteed by the con stitution. on behalf of the respondents an affidavit has been made by the sub divisional officer, barnala, in which it has been stated, inter alia, that \"the property is trust property of a public and charitable character and the petitioners are not entitled to claim any property rights in respect of the same\". assuming that the property is trust property of the nature suggested, no attempt has been made in the affidavit to show under what authority of law the state or its executive officers were justified in taking the action that was taken against the petitioners in respect of the dhar masala. learned counsel for the respondents has sought to justify that action on the ground that the petitioners were mere trespassers and as the land on which the dharmasala stood belonged to the state, the respondents were entitled to use the minimum of force to eject the trespassers. secondly be has contended, on the strength of the decision of this court in sohan lal vs the union of india (1), that there is a serious dispute on questions of fact between the parties in this case and also whether the petitioners have any right or title to the subject matter of dispute; therefore, proceedings by way of a writ are not appropriate in this case inasmuch as the decision of the (1) [1957] s.c.r. 738. 78 court would amount to a decree declaring a party 's title and ordering restoration of possession. we consider that both these contentions are unsound and the petitioners have made out a clear case of the violation of their fundamental rights. there has been some argument before us as to the true legal effect of the sanction granted in 1909 to ramji das subject to the conditions adverted to earlier: whether it was a lease in favour of the firm faquir chand bhagwan das; whether it was a licence coupled with a grant or an irrevocable licence within the meaning of section 60(b) of the easements act, 1882. these are disputed questions which we do not think that we are called upon to decide in the present proceeding.", "completion": "after the death of ramji das on december 10, 1957, the petitioners continued the management of the dharmasala, temple and the shops appurtenant thereto.\nthis led to fresh researches into the old papers, and this time the sub divisional officer, barnala, recommended that in the interest of government (sometime before this barnala come into the punjab state) the municipal committee, barnala, should take immediate charge of the management of the dharmasala.\none shri ramji das was appointed as manager vide order of the revenue minister of the erstwhile state of patiala dated 26 12 1987bk of the property, as cited subject.\nc. in anticipation of approval of the government.\" in pursuance of the direction given by the deputy commissioner, the kanungo presumably in accordance 77 with the orders of the sub divisional officer, barnala, dispossessed the petitioners from part of the dharmasala on january 7, 1958, and made over charge of the same to the municipal committee, barnala.\non behalf of the respondents an affidavit has been made by the sub divisional officer, barnala, in which it has been stated, inter alia, that \"the property is trust property of a public and charitable character and the petitioners are not entitled to claim any property rights in respect of the same\".\nassuming that the property is trust property of the nature suggested, no attempt has been made in the affidavit to show under what authority of law the state or its executive officers were justified in taking the action that was taken against the petitioners in respect of the dhar masala."}

(3) (1927) l.r 54 i.a. 218. 79 that in respect of the dharmasala, temples and shops, the state has acquired any rights whatsoever merely by reason of their being on the land belonging to the state. if the state thought that the constructions should be removed or that the condition as to resumption of the land should be invoked, it was open to the state to take appropriate legal action for the purpose. even if the state proceeded on the footing that the trust was a public trust it should have taken appropriate legal action for the removal of the trustee as was opined by the state 's legal remembrancer. it is well recognised that a suit under section 92, civil procedure code, may be brought against persons in possession of the trust property even if they claim adversely to the trust, that is, claim to be owners of the property, or against persons who deny the validity of the trust. learned counsel for the respondents has drawn our attention to the statement of ramji das made ill 1925 and the order of the revenue minister dated december 13, 1954, and has contended that ramji das himself admitted that he was a more trustee. be that so; but that does not give the state or its executive officers the right to take the law into their own hands and remove the trustee by an executive order. we must, therefore, repel the argument based on the contention that the petitioners were trespassers and could be removed by an executive order. the argument is not only specious but highly dangerous by reason of its implications and impact on law and order. as to the second argument, it is enough to say that it is unnecessary in this case to determine any disputed questions of fact or even to determine what precise right the petitioners obtained by the sanction granted to their firm in 1909. it is enough to say that they are bona fide in possession of the constructions in question and could not be removed except under authority of law. the respondents clearly violated their fundamental rights by depriving them of possession of the dharmasala by executive orders. those orders must be quashed and the respondents must now be restrained from interfering with the 80 petitioners in the management of the dharmasala, temple and shops. a writ will now issue accordingly. before we part with this case, we feel it our duty to say that the executive action taken in this case by the state and its officers is destructive of the basic principle of the rule of law. the facts and the position in law thus clearly are (1) that the buildings constructed on this piece of government land did not belong to government, (2) that the petitioners were in possession and occupation of the buildings and (3) that by virtue of enactments binding on the government, the petitioners could be dispossessed, if at all, only in pursuance of a decree of a civil court obtained in proceedings properly initiated. in these circumstances the action of the government in taking the law into their hands and dispossessing the petitioners by the display of force, exhibits a callous disregard of the normal requirements of the rule of law apart from what might legitimately and reasonably be expected from a government functioning in a society governed by a constitution which guarantees to its citizens against arbitrary invasion by the executive of peaceful possession of property. as pointed out by this court in wazir chand vs the state of himachal pradesh (1), the state or its executive officers cannot in terfere with the rights of others unless they can point to some specific rule of law which authorises their acts. in ram prasad narayan sahi vs the state of bihar (2) this court said that nothing is more likely to drain the vitality from the rule of law than legislation which singles out a particular individual from his fellow subjects and visits him with a disability which is not imposed upon the others.", "completion": "the admitted position, so far as the present proceeding is concerned, is that the land belonged to the state;

(a) thereof. clause (a) provides that any custom applicable to the parties concerned, which is not contrary to justice, equity or good conscience, and has not been by this or any other enactment altered or abolished and has not been declared to be void by any competent authority shall be applied in such matters. the position therefore that emerges is, where the parties are hindus, the hindu law would apply in the first instance and whosoever asserts a custom at variance with the hindu law shall have to prove it, though the quantum of proof required in support of the custom which is general and well recognised may be small while in other cases of what are called special customs the quantum may be larger. as was pointed out by robertson, j., as far back as 1906 in daya ram vs sohel singh and others (1), \"in all cases under section 5 of the , it lies upon the person asserting that he is ruled (1) 1906 p. r. no. 110. 473 in regard to a particular matter by custom, to prove that he is so governed, and not by personal law, and further to prove what the particular custom is. there is no presumption created by the clause in favour of custom; on the contrary it is only when the custom is established that it is to be the rule of decision. \" these observations were approved by the privy council in abdul hussein khan vs bibi sona dero and another (1). the same view has been taken by this court in ujagar singh vs mst. jeo (2). we have therefore in the first instance to apply hindu law to the parties to this suit, and it is only when a custom different from hindu law is proved that rights of the parties would be governed by that custom. munshi ram 's case was that he was adopted by ata according to custom (i.e., in accordance with the mode prevalent in the community for purposes of adoption) during the lifetime of hans raj. thus munshi ram having been adopted by ata would have no right left in the family of his natural father hans raj, unless the adoption was in the dvyamushyayana form.", "completion": "this is an appeal by special leave from the judgment of the punjab high court and arises out of a suit for possession of land brought by munshi ram, respondent.\nthe following pedigreetable will be useful in understanding the claim put forward by the respondent: heman karori laghi maghi jai dayal (issueless) gobind ata nanak chand santu munshi ram (adopted son) plaintiff hans raj salig kam ( defdt.) munshiram (adopted by ata) the claim of munshi ram was with respect to the property left by nanak chand who is his natural grandfather and also santu.\nit will be clear from these dates therefore that hans raj never succeeded to the property of his father nanak chand and munshi ram had been adopted by ata even before hans raj 's death.\nthe case of munshi ram was that he was entitled to one half share of the property left by nanak chand as his their, according to zamindara custom.\nthe parties, it may be mentioned, are brahmins and munshi ram claimed joint possession of the half share of the property left by nanak chand on his 472 death.\nhis case was that munshi ram was not entitled either according to personal law or the riwaj i am of amritsar district to any share in the property left by nanak chand.\nas was pointed out by robertson, j., as far back as 1906 in daya ram vs sohel singh and others (1), \"in all cases under section 5 of the , it lies upon the person asserting that he is ruled (1) 1906 p.\nmunshi ram 's case was that he was adopted by ata according to custom (i.e., in accordance with the mode prevalent in the community for purposes of adoption) during the lifetime of hans raj."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: it was however never the case of munshi ram that the adoption was in dvyamushyayana form and so far as hindu law is concerned, if it applies to this case munfshi ram would not be entitled after the adoption to succeed to the property left by nanak chand. but munshi ram 's case was that according to zamindara custom he was entitled to succeed to half of the properties left by nanak chand. the question therefore arises: what the zamindara custom is in the present case. in the plaint the custom was not actually pleaded, though strictly speaking this should have been done. however, the custom that is relied upon is to be found in para. 48 of the digest of customary law in the punjab by rattigan at p. 572, 13th edition. this paragraph appears in section v dealing with \"effect of adoption on succession\" and is in the following terms: \"an heir appointed in the manner above described ordinarily does not thereby lose his right to succeed (1) (1917) l. r. 45 i. a. 10, 13. (2) [1959] supp. 2 s.c. r. 781 60 474 to property in his natural family, as against collaterals, but does not succeed in the presence of his natural brothers. \" it is not disputed before ,is that para. 48 applies in the case of adoption also; but what is contended on behalf of the appellant is that para. 48 only mentions a custom prevalent throughout the punjab while the riwaj i am of amritsar district from which area the parties come also records a custom confined to that area which really governs the parties. it appears that in 1865 the riwaj i am of amritsar district stated that \"an adopted son will not be a co sharer amongst his brothers, in the property left by his natural father\", i.e., a son given away in adoption will not inherit in the natural father 's family. we may in this connection refer to jai kaur and others vs sher singh and others (1), where this court held that \"there is therefore an initial presumption of correctness as regards the entries in the riwaj i am and when the custom as recorded in the riwaj i am is in conflict with the general custom as recorded in rattigan 's digest or ascertained otherwise, the entries in the riwaj i am should ordinarily prevail except that as was pointed out by the judicial committee of the, privy council in a recent decision in mt. subhani vs nawab (2), that where, a,% in the present case, the riwaj i am affects adversely the rights of females who had no opportunity whatever of appearing before the revenue authorities, the presumption would be weak, and only a few instances would suffice to rebut it. \" as females are not concerned in this case, the entries in the riwaj i am of amritsar district in 1865, if they conflict with para. 48 of rattigan 's digest,, should prevail. on that view munshi ram would have no right to succeed in the family of his natural father after he was adopted by ata. the high court, however, pointed out that there were decisions of courts which did not accept the riwaj i am of amritsar district of 1865 as laying down the correct custom and therefore para. 48 of the digest by rattigan would still prevail. (1) a.i. r. (2) a.i.r. 1941 p.c. 21. 475 in this connection the high court relied on majja singh and others vs rain singh (1). that was however a case of jats and not of brahmins and the person who was adopted in that case was an only son. that case would not therefore necessarily override the custom so far as it applies to brahmins. in any case the position is made clear by the manual of customary law prepared in 1911 12 by mr. cralk. the custom recorded in that compilation is that with the exception of brahmins and khatris, an adopted son does not retain his right to inherit from his natural father, even if the latter dies without leaving any other son. the high court however pointed out that the brahmin,,; and khatris did not accept this custom; but it failed to notice a further paragraph in answer to that very question where it was pointed out that among brahmins and khatris the same custom prevailed except that where there was no other son, the son who was adopted in another family would succeed to the property of his natural father. in 1940 the customary law of amritsar district was again compiled and the custom recorded is that an adopted son loses his right to inherit from his natural father but if the latter dies without other sons the adopted son cannot inherit as a son but may inherit collaterally as a successor of his adoptive father. the position as it emerges from a comparison of the entries in the riwaj i am of 1865, 1911 12 and 1940 is somewhat confused and the high court therefore thought that the custom recorded in para. 48 should be adhered to as brahmins and khatris did not accept the extreme position that as on given away in adoption was excluded altogether from succeeding in his natural father 's family as recorded in 1911,12. this conclusion seems to be fortified by the statements of brahmins and khatris in 1911 12 that a son given away in adoption succeeded in the family of his natural father if he had no brothers though the high court did not notice this part of the answer in the riwaj i am of 1911 12.", "completion": "it appears that in 1865 the riwaj i am of amritsar district stated that \"an adopted son will not be a co sharer amongst his brothers, in the property left by his natural father\", i.e., a son given away in adoption will not inherit in the natural father 's family.\nwe may in this connection refer to jai kaur and others vs sher singh and others (1), where this court held that \"there is therefore an initial presumption of correctness as regards the entries in the riwaj i am and when the custom as recorded in the riwaj i am is in conflict with the general custom as recorded in rattigan 's digest or ascertained otherwise, the entries in the riwaj i am should ordinarily prevail except that as was pointed out by the judicial committee of the, privy council in a recent decision in mt.\nthe custom recorded in that compilation is that with the exception of brahmins and khatris, an adopted son does not retain his right to inherit from his natural father, even if the latter dies without leaving any other son.\nthe high court however pointed out that the brahmin,,; and khatris did not accept this custom; but it failed to notice a further paragraph in answer to that very question where it was pointed out that among brahmins and khatris the same custom prevailed except that where there was no other son, the son who was adopted in another family would succeed to the property of his natural father.\nin 1940 the customary law of amritsar district was again compiled and the custom recorded is that an adopted son loses his right to inherit from his natural father but if the latter dies without other sons the adopted son cannot inherit as a son but may inherit collaterally as a successor of his adoptive father.\n48 should be adhered to as brahmins and khatris did not accept the extreme position that as on given away in adoption was excluded altogether from succeeding in his natural father 's family as recorded in 1911,12.\nthis conclusion seems to be fortified by the statements of brahmins and khatris in 1911 12 that a son given away in adoption succeeded in the family of his natural father if he had no brothers though the high court did not notice this part of the answer in the riwaj i am of 1911 12."}

secondly, it is contended on behalf of the respondents that the subsequent proceedings taken in pursuance of the demand notice aforesaid do not in any way violate the right of equal protection of the laws guaranteed under article 14 of the constitution. it is convenient at this stage to refer to some of the earlier decisions of this court on the question of con. stitutionality of some of the provisions of the act. on may 28, 1954, this court delivered judgment in suraj mall mohta and co. vs a. v. visvanatha sastri and another (1). it is not necessary to state the facts of that decision. it is enough to say that it was held therein that sub section (4) of section 5 of the act war, bad, as it offended the provisions of article 14 of the constitution. sub section (4) of section 5 of the act having been declared void, parliament passed the indian income tax amendment act (33 of 1954) amending section 34 of the indian income tax act, 1922. as a result of this amendment, the validity of sub section (1) of section 5 of the act came in for challenge on the ground that the income tax officer could pick out some out of the class of substantial tax evaders and refer their cases under sub section (1) of section 5 while dealing with other such persons under amended section 34 of the indian income tax act. in shree meenakshi mills ltd., madurai v. a. v. viswanatha sastri and another(2), sub section (1) ' of section 5 of the act was held to be bad on that ground. it should be noted that in none of the petitions disposed of by that judgment had any assessment been made under the act and this court only prohibited further proceedings before the commission under the act, finally, on december 20, 1955, came the decision of this court in m. ct. muthiah & two others vs the commissioner of income tax, madras & another (3). in that case, on a reference under b. 5(1) of the act, the commission submitted its report to government under (1) ;

secondly, it is contended on behalf of the respondents that the subsequent proceedings taken in pursuance of the demand notice aforesaid do not in any way violate the right of equal protection of the laws guaranteed under article 14 of the constitution.\nas a result of this amendment, the validity of sub section (1) of section 5 of the act came in for challenge on the ground that the income tax officer could pick out some out of the class of substantial tax evaders and refer their cases under sub section (1) of section 5 while dealing with other such persons under amended section 34 of the indian income tax act.\nin these circumstances it was held: \"the result, therefore, is that barring the cases of persons which were already concluded by reports made by the commission and the directions given by the central government under section 8(2) of the act xxx of 1947 culminating in the assessment or reassessment of the escaped income, those cases which were pending on the 26th january 1950 for investigation before the commission as also the assessment or reassessment proceedings which were pending on the 26th january 1950 before the income tax officers concerned in pursuance of the directions given by the central government under section 8(2) of the act would be hit by article 14 of the constitution and would be invalidated."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: it was held therein that the settlement was the result of a procedure which became discriminatory after the commencement of the constitution and was therefore bad, and as the discriminatory process of investigation continued even after the commencement of the constitution, the principle laid down in syed qasim razvi vs the state of hyderabad and others (2 ) did not apply. the point which requires emphasis with regard to these earlier decisions is this: they all dealt with the operation of a discriminatory procedure under the different provisions of the act after the commencement of the constitution. the position in the case under our present consideration is that the settlement, the order under section 8 a(2) of the act, and even the notice of damaged in pursuance of that order all these took (1) [1959] supp. 1 s.c. r. 528. (2) 973 place before the coming into force of the constitution, and this ' vital distinction must be borne in mind in considering the contentions urged by learned counsel for the petitioner. the main contention is that the proceedings taken against the petitioner in pursuance of the order under section 8 a(2) are violative of the guarantee of equal protection of the laws under article 14 of the constitution. there are, however, two subsidiary contentions which do not directly raise any question of the violation of a fundamental right, and these may be disposed of before we deal with the main contention. in his petition the petitioner has stated that he received the demand notice dated december 2, 1949 in or about april, 1950. in the counter affidavit of the respondents it has been stated that the assessee was informed of the demand early in december, 1949. a copy of the order of the central government under section 8 a(2) of the act dated november 21, 1949, was sent to the petitioner; there is an endorsement in the office copy of the demand notice dated december 2, 1949, that it was sent by registered post, acknowledgment due. thereafter, the petitioner paid part of the tax on different dates without raising any objection that he had not received the demand notice before april, 1950. it was for the first time in april, 1959, some ten years after, that the petitioner asked for a copy of the order under section 8 a(2) and information as to the date when he had received the regis tered notice of demanad. he also asked for an inspection of the file. this was, however, refused. then, the petitioner made the statement that he had received the demand notice in or about april, 1950. he said that the statement was based on his knowledge; he did not disclose the source of his knowledge nor did he say how he remembered ten years after, without reference to any documents, that he had received the demand notice in or about april, 1950. we are unable to accept the statement as correct. on the materials in the record it is clear that the proceedings against the petitioner culminating in the service of the notice of demand against him were all completed 974 before the coming into force of the constitution and the petitioner cannot challenge those proceedings under article 14 of the constitution; for it is well settled that the constitution is prospective and not retrospective. on the construction of section 8 a of the act it has been argued that after the order made by the central government under sub section (2) thereof, a fresh assessment was necessary and as no such assessment was made, all subsequent proceedings for recovery of the tax are illegal. this is a point which has not been specifically taken in the petition. that apart, we do not think that there is any substance in this contention. we may here read section 8 a, so far as it is relevant: \"section 8 a. (1) where any person concerned in any case referred to or pending before the commission for investigation applies to the commission at any time during such investigation to have the case or any part thereof settled in so far as it relates to him, the commission shall, if it is of opinion that the terms of the settlement contained in the application may be approved, refer the matter to the central government, and if the central government accepts the terms of such settlement, the commission shall have the terms thereof recorded and thereupon the investigation, in so far as it relates to matters covered by such settlement, shall be deemed to be closed.

against all other debtors government have the ordinary remedy by way of suit but against the petitioner a special remedy is provided which is more drastic and envisages the imposition of a penalty under section 46 of the indian income tax act, 1922, if the petitioner is in default in making a payment of the amount due. this, it is argued, is a discriminatory procedure which has been continued even after the coming into force of the constitution. we are unable to accept this argument as correct. first of all, the petitioner does not really belong to the larger class of persons whom learned counsel has characterised as debtors of government. the petitioner belongs to a special class who had evaded payment of income tax and had entered into a settlement to pay the amount due as income tax or arrear of income tax. for this class of persons the procedure laid down in section 8 a(2) is one and the same, and no discrimination is made in favour of or against any member of the same class. the classification is a, reasonable classification having a just relation to the object of the pro vision. for the recovery of the amount due as income tax or arrear of income tax all these persons are treated on the same, footing. neither is there any discrimination between them and other persons similarly placed in the matter of recovery of income tax.or arrears of income tax. secondly, it is open to the legislature to make a law as to how particular government dues should be realised and if the law applies equally to all persons similarly situated, no objection call be taken to such law on the ground of discrimination. the truth of the matter is that what the petitioner agreed to pay to government is really income tax which should have been paid in regard to the relevant assessment years but which had escaped assessment and therefore the recovery is to be made according to income tax law. that is all that section 8 a(2) says. in the decisions of this court to which we bad earlier adverted, what was held to be bad was 977 the application of a discriminatory procedure after the coming into force of the constitution;. even in basheshar nath 's case (1) the commission applied the discriminatory procedure after the coming into force of the constitution and then submitted its report on may 24, 1954, and the central government accepted the settlement on july 5, 1954. it was held that the settlement itself was vitiated by the discriminatory procedure adopted by the commission. that is not the position here. in this case everything was con cluded before january 26, 1950, when the constitution came into force, including the issuance of a notice of demand. all that remained to be done was the recovery of the amount according to the notice of demand. therefore, the crucial question is is the recovery procedure discriminatory in any way, having regard to the undoubted validity of the proceedings which had been taken against the petitioner before ,january 26, 1950? we are unable to answer this question in favour of the petitioner for the reasons which we have already stated. learned counsel for the petitioner relied on the decision in m. l. m. muthiah chettiar and others vs commissioner of income tax, madras (2).", "completion": "that is not the position under section 8 a, sub section (2) whereof provides for the enforcement of the terms of any settlement arrived at in pursuance, of sub section there is do doubt a reference to certain special provisions of the indian income tax act, 1922, regarding assessment of partners in a registered firm, tax payable by the representative of a deceased person etc.;

shares with dividend or interest thereon and directing palaniappa chettiar to pay the plaintiff and the third defendant the sum of rs. 25,000. this suit was dis missed on the 17th november, 1943, on the ground that sundara ayyar, who was only a member of the dissolved company, had no locus standi and could 357 have no relief personally. sundara ayyar filed an appeal therefrom which was dismissed as against the mills but the case was remanded to the trial court for the trial of his claim as against the fourth defendant, palaniappa chettiar. during the pendency of sundara ayyar 's appeal he on the 12th august, 1944, filed o.p. no. 199 of 1944 for the restoration of the company. on that application an order was made on the 16th february, 1945, that the name of the company be restored to the register of companies, that the company be deemed to have continued in existence as if its name had never been struck off, that such restoration be advertised and that the company be wound up by the court and the official receiver do forthwith take charge of the assets and liabilities of the company. it was further ordered that the official receiver do recognise that as between the mills and the company, the mills should be regarded as having been duly paid only rs. 11,000 out of the total debt of rs. 25,550 due ' to the mills. by an order made on the 21st january, 1946, leave was given to the official receiver to take appropriate steps regarding the 5,000 shares purported to have been forfeited by the mills. accordingly on the 5th march, 1946, the official receiver, in the name of the company, took out the present summons calling upon all parties concerned to show cause why the share register of the mills should not be rectified by restoring the name of the company to the said register in respect of 5,000 shares numbering 15048 20047 and why such other alternative or consequential relief should not be granted to the applicant as might be just and necessary in the circumstances of the case. the mills contended, in opposition to that application, that the shares had been properly forfeited, that the company was, on the principles of estoppel, acquiescence and laches, precluded from challenging the forfeiture, that the application was barred by limitation and that the shares having already been allotted to other persons, who had not been made 358 parties to the application, order for rectification of the register in respect of those shares could be made. the summons came up for hearing before mr. justice clark. the learned judge, by his judgment dated

passed on the 5th september, 1941, was founded, was not in conformity with the provisions of articles 29 and 30 of the articles of association of the company which required 14 clear days ' notice. the learned judge further held that the plea of estoppel, acquiescence and laches was untenable, that article 49 of the limitation act did not apply either expressly or by way of analogy to the present application and that article 120, which prescribed a period of six years from the date when the right to sue accrued, would, by analogy, apply to the present proceedings and that so applied the

the 5,000 shares was illegal and inoperative and directing the mills to pay to the plaintiff and the third defendant representing the estate of govindaraju chettiar the value of the forfeited shares with dividend or interest thereon and directing palaniappa chettiar to pay the plaintiff and the third defendant the sum of rs.\non that application an order was made on the 16th february, 1945, that the name of the company be restored to the register of companies, that the company be deemed to have continued in existence as if its name had never been struck off, that such restoration be advertised and that the company be wound up by the court and the official receiver do forthwith take charge of the assets and liabilities of the company.\nit was further ordered that the official receiver do recognise that as between the mills and the company, the mills should be regarded as having been duly paid only rs.\naccordingly on the 5th march, 1946, the official receiver, in the name of the company, took out the present summons calling upon all parties concerned to show cause why the share register of the mills should not be rectified by restoring the name of the company to the said register in respect of 5,000 shares numbering 15048 20047 and why such other alternative or consequential relief should not be granted to the applicant as might be just and necessary in the circumstances of the case.\nthe mills contended, in opposition to that application, that the shares had been properly forfeited, that the company was, on the principles of estoppel, acquiescence and laches, precluded from challenging the forfeiture, that the application was barred by limitation and that the shares having already been allotted to other persons, who had not been made 358 parties to the application, order for rectification of the register in respect of those shares could be made."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: it is quite clear that the specific shares having already been allotted to 14 different persons and those persons not being then before the court, the court could not then and there direct rectification of the register by restoring the name of the company to the share register of the mills in respect of those identical shares. there was nevertheless nothing to prevent the court even at that stage to give notice of the application to the persons to whom the shares had been reallotted and/or those who were holding the shares at the time and after thus adding them as parties thereto to make the appropriate order of rectification and, if thought fit, to also award damages to the company. there were, however, 16,000 shares of rs. 10 each yet unissued. after discussing the matter with learned advocates on both sides to which, discussion a reference will be made hereafter the 359 learned judge, in the belief that the advocates for the parties had agreed as to the form of the order, directed that the mills do rectify their register by inserting the name of the applicant company as owner of 5,000 shares out of the unissued shares of rs. 10 each and that on such insertion the company do on or before the 15th january, 1947, pay to the mills rs. 25,000, being the amount of calls in arrears. pursuant to further directions given by the learned judge on the 7th january, 1947, the mills on the 10th january, 1947, received rs. 25,000 and allotted 5,000 shares. although the mills thus acted upon the order they, nevertheless, on the 6th february, 1947, filed an appeal against the order. that appeal came up for hearing before a bench consisting of satyanarayana rao and viswanatha sastri jj. it was not disputed before the appeal court that the forfeiture was invalid, but the contentions urged were that by reason of the irregularity the forfeiture was only voidable and not void and that as the forfeiture was only voidable it was open to the company to waive or abandon its right to dispute the validity of the forfeiture and that in fact, by its conduct, it had done so, that the claim to rectify the register was barred by limitation and that in any event rectification was impossible because the shares were not available in specie, the same having been reallotted to other persons. the learned judges by their judgment dated the 11th march 1949, held that the forfeiture was invalid, that the application was not barred by limitation for it was covered by article 120 of the limitation act. the learned judges recognised that where a period of limitation was prescribed for a suit or a proceeding mere delay was no bar unless it was of such a character as would lead to an inference of abandonment of the right or unless it: was established that the person against whom the action or proceeding was instituted was actually prejudiced by reason of such delay. the learned judges agreed with the 47 360 trial court that no plea of acquiescence, waiver or estoppel had been established in the present case. the learned judges, nevertheless, thought that the question of abandonment of the right and prejudice to the appellant by reason of the delay stood on a different footing. then after referring to certain conduct on the part of govindaraju chettiar and sundara ayyar the learned judges concluded that by reason of the long delay in reviving the company and in taking proceedings under section 38 of the indian companies act the mills had been induced to put themselves in a situation in which it became impossible for them to restore the company to the register in respect of those 5,000 shares and that in view of this conduct, if the applicants were govindaraju chettiar and sundara ayyar, it would have been a case in which relief would have been refused in the light of the principles which the learned judges deduced from the judicial decisions referred to by them. then referring to the decision in smith, stone & knight vs birmingham corporation (1) and certain text books the learned judges took the view that it was too late in the day to adhere to the strict formalism laid down in salomon 's case (2) and that as the tendency of modern decisions was to lift the veil of corporate personality and disregard the corporate form, the conduct of its only two members had disentitled the company from claiming the relief of rectification. the learned judges further held that there was no legal basis on which the form of the order could be supported. on reading the judgment of the trial judge and after hearing the senior advocate appearing for the mills the learned judges felt unable to agree that the learned advocate had agreed to the substitution of, the 6,000 out of the unissued shares for the 5,000 forfeited shares. the resilt was that the appeal was allowed and the order of the trial judge was set aside. the company by its official receiver has now come up before this court with leave granted by the high court (1) (2) ; 361 under sections 109 and 110 of the code of civil procedure. the appeal court, it will be observed, reversed the decision of the trial judge and decided the appeal against the company on two grounds only, namely, (1) that the company had by the conduct of its two members abandoned its right to challenge the forfeiture, and (2) that the form of the order could not be supported as one validly made under section 38 of the indian companies act.", "completion": "after discussing the matter with

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: the learned attorneygeneral, appearing in support of this appeal, has assailed the soundness of both these grounds. the learned attorney general contends, not without considerable force, that having, in agreement with the trial coury, held that no plea of acquiescence, waiver or estoppel had been established in this case, the appeal court should not have allowed the mills to raise the question of abandonment of right by the company, inasmuch as no such plea of abandon ment had been raised either in the mills ' affidavit in opposition to the company 's application or in the mills grounds of appeal before the high court. apart from this, the appeal court permitted the mills to make out a plea of abandonment of right by the company ,as distinct from the pleas of waiver, acquiescence and estoppel and sought to derive support for this new plea from the well known cases of prendergast vs turton(1), clark & chapman vs hart(2) and jones vs north vancouver land and improvement, co.(3). a perusal of the relevant facts set out in the several reports and the respective judgments in the above cases will clearly indicate that apart from the fact that some of them related to collieries which were treated on a special footing, those cases were really cases relating to waiver or acquiescence or estoppel. indeed in clarke 's case (2) while lord chelms ford referred to the decision in prendergast 's case(1) as a case of abandonment of right, lord wensleydale read it as an instance of acquiescence and estoppel. unilateral act or conduct of a person, (1) ; (3) [1910] a.c. 317.

'in order to give rise to an estoppel against the company, such acts or conduct amounting to abandonment must be anterior to the mills ' changing its position to its detriment. the resolution for forfeiture was passed on the 6th september, 1941. the five thousand forfeited shares were allotted to 14 persons on the 16th november, 1941, and it is such ,allotment that made it impossible for the mill& to give them back to the company. in order, therefore, to sustain a plea of abandonment of right or estoppel, it must be shown that the company or either of its two members had done some act and/or had been guilty of some conduct between the 6th september, 1941, and the 16th november, 1941. no such act or conduct during such period has been or can be pointed out. on being pressed advocate for the mills refers us to the conduct of sundara ayyar in opposing o.p. no. 10 'of 1942 filed by the mills and o.p. no. 11 of 1942 by the income tax authorities for restoring the company to the register of companies and it is submitted that such conduct indicates that sundara ayyar had accepted the validity of the forfeiture. this was long after the mills had reallotted the forfeited shares. further, a perusal of paragraph 9 of the affidavit in opposition filed by sundara ayyar in o.p. no. 10 of 1942 will clearly show that he not only did not accept the forfeiture as valid but actually repudiated such forfeiture as wholly beyond the competence of the board of directors of the mills. the reason for opposing the restoration of the company may well have been that sundara ayyar desired, at all cost, to avoid his eventual personal liability as a shareholder and director of the company. in any case, sundara ayyar did make it clear that he challenged the validity of the purported forfeiture of shares by the mills and in this respect this case falls clearly within the decision in clarke 's case (1) relied upon by the appeal court. the only other conduct of sundara ayyar relied on by learned advocate for the mills in (1) ; 6 h.l.c. 632; 365 support of the appeal court 's decision on this point is that sundara ayyar proceeded with his suit against palaniappa chettiar even after his suit as well as his appeal had been dismissed as against the mills. in that suit sundara. ayyar sued the mills as well as govindaraju chettiar and the official receiver of salem representing the latter 's estate and palaniappa chettiar. in the plaint itself the validity of the forfeiture was challenged. the claim against palani appa chettiar was in the alternative and it was founded on the agreement of the 30th june, 1939. the suit was dismissed as against the mills only on the technical ground that sundara ayyar had no locus standi to maintain the suit. the contention of the company that the forfeiture was invalid and the claim for rectification of the share register of the mills by restoring the name of the company cannot possibly have been affected by this decision. sundara ayyar 's claim against palaniappa chettiar was based on the agreement of 1939 and it was formulated as an alternative personal claim. in view of the clear allegation in the plaint that the forfeiture was invalid and not binding on the company, the continuation of the suit by sundara ayyar to enforce his personal claim against palaniappa chettiar cannot be regarded as an abandonment by sundara ayyar of the right of the company. it must not be overlooked that the company stood dissolved on that date and sundara ayyar had no authority to do anything on behalf of the company. in our opinion there is no evidence of abandonment of the company 's right to challenge the validity of the purported forfeiture. the second point on which the appeal court decided the appeal against the company was that the form of the order made by the trial court could not be supported as one validly made under section 38 of the indian companies act. it will be recalled that having disposed of all the points of controversy against the mills and in favour of the company the trial judge had to consider the ' form of the order which could properly be made in favour of the 366 company. in the summons the company had asked for rectification of the register by restoring the name of the company to the register in respect of 5,000 shares numbering 15048 to 20047.", "completion": ", but not conceding, that the principle of piercing the veil of corporate personality referred to in smith, stone & knight vs the birmingham corporation (3) can at all be applied to the facts of the present case so as to enable the court to impute the acts or conduct of govindaraju chettiar and sundara ayyar to the company, we have yet to inquire whether those acts or conduct do establish such abandonment of rights as would, according to the decisions, disentitle the plaintiff from questioning the validity of the purported declaration of forfeiture.\non being pressed advocate for the mills refers us to the conduct of sundara ayyar in opposing o.p. no.\n11 of 1942 by the income tax authorities for restoring the company to the register of companies and it is submitted that such conduct indicates that sundara ayyar had accepted the validity of the forfeiture.\nin any case, sundara ayyar did make it clear that he challenged the validity of the purported forfeiture of shares by the mills and in this respect this case falls clearly within the decision in clarke 's case (1) relied upon by the appeal court.\nthe only other conduct of sundara ayyar relied on by learned advocate for the mills in (1) ;

circumstances, be impossible to make an order for rectification with respect to those specific shares which, as already stated, had been reallotted to other persons who were not parties to the proceedings. the mills had also reduced its capital by having the face value of the 84,000 shares which had been issued reduced by repaying to the shareholders rs. 5 in respect of each of those shares. there were, however, 16,000 unissued shares of rs. 10 each which were not affected by the reduction. while, therefore, it was clearly impossible for the court to direct that the company should be replaced on the register in respect of its original shares, the court could, under section 38, give notice to the persons to whom the shares had been reallotted or those claiming under them and make them parties to the proceedings and then make an appropriate order for ' rectification and, if necessary, also direct the mills to pay damages under that section. this being the situation learned advocate for the mills had to decide upon his course of action. what happened in court will appear from the following extract from the judgment of the trial court: \" it is agreed by both parties that the proper order will be for the applicant company to be placed on the register in respect of 5,000 of the unissued rupees 10 shares and i order accordingly. in this case as the parties consent to the

this difficulty to me. . . . . the suggestion of the applicant company is that it is prepared to forego any claim to the accrued dividends if it is not required to pay interest on the outstanding call money. this seems to me to be a very 367 reasonable suggestion. . . i direct accordingly that on insertion of the name of the applicant company as owner of 6,000of the unissued shares the applicant company shall pay to the respondent company only rs. 25,000 being the amount of calls in arrears. \" the appeal court, however, went behind this record of the proceedings that took place before the trial court and heard the learned senior advocate as to what had happened in court and after hearing the senior advocate for the mills found itself unable to agree with the contention that the learned advocate for the mills had agreed to the substitution of 5,000 unissued shares for the shares forfeited. no affidavit of the learned senior advocate was filed before the trial court for the

referred to in timmalapalli virabhadra rao vs sokalchand chunilal & others (2). while we do not consider it necessary or desirable to lay down any hard and fast rule, we certainly take the view that the course suggested by the privy council should ordinarily be taken. it. appears that at the time when the application was made for leave to appeal to the federal court an affidavit sworn by g. vasantha pai, the junior advocate for the mills, was filed before the court dealing with that application. paragraph 5 of that affidavit runs as follows: \"during the trial every question was argued on behalf of the respondent company and no point was given up. this will be clear from the fact that till we reached the penultimate paragraph of the judgment beginning 'it now remains to consider, etc. ' all the issues are dealt with by the learned judge. the agreement was on the specific form of the order on the basis of his lordship 's judgment and without prejudice to the respondent company 's rights. what (1) (2) 48 368 was agreed to was \"proper order\" on the basis of his lordship 's judgment which by then had been dictated. the respondent company no more consented to the order that

(2) 372 not, however, on this occasion, pursue the matter further, for we are of the,opinion that even if article 181 does apply to the present application it may still be said to be within time. the period of limitation prescribed by that article is three years from the time when the right to apply accrues. \" it is true that a further notice after the shares are forfeited, is not necessary to complete the forfeiture of the shares see knight 's case(1)], but it is difficult to see how a person whose share is forfeited and whose name is struck out from the register can apply for rectification of the register until he comes to know of the forfeiture. the same terminus a quo is also prescribed in article 120 of the limitation act. in o.r.m.o. m.sp. (firm) vs nagappa chettiar(2) which was a suit to recover trust property from a person who had taken it, with notice of the trust, by a transaction which was a breach of trust, the privy council approved and applied the principles of the earlier indian decisions referred to therein to the case before them and held that the time began to run under article 120 after the plaintiff came to know of the transaction which gave him the right to sue. on the same reasoning we are prepared to extend that principle to the present application under article 181. if article 181 applies then time began to run after the company came to know of its right to sue. it is not alleged that the company had any knowledge of the forfeiture between the 5th september, 1941, when the resolution of forfeiture was passed and the 9th september, 1941, when the company became defunct. after the last mentioned date and up to the 16th february, 1945, the company stood dissolved and no knowledge or notice can be imputed to the company during this period. therefore, the company must be deemed to have come to know of its cause of action after it came to life again and the present application was certainly made well within three years after that event happened on the 16th february, 1945. if article 181 does not apply then the only article that can (1) (2) i.l.r. 373 apply by analogy is article 120 and the application is also within time. in either view this application cannot be thrown out as barred by limitation. the result, therefore, is that this appeal must succeed. we set aside the judgment and decree of the high court in appeal and restore the order of the trial court. the appellant will be entitled to the costs of the appeal in the high court as well as in this court. bose j. i agree with the conclusions of my learned brothers and also with their reasoning generally but lest it be inferred that i am assenting to a far wider proposition than is actually the case, i deem it advisable to clarify my position about abandonment and waiver. though the usage of these words in cases of the present kind has the sanction of high authority, they are, in my opinion, inapt and mislead ing in this class of case. in order to appreciate this it will be necessary to hark back to first principles. in the first place, waiver and abandonment are in their primary context unilateral acts. waiver is the intentional relinquishment of a right or privilege. abandonment is the voluntary giving up of one 's rights and privileges or interest in property with the intention of never claiming them again. but except where statutory or other limitations intervene, unilateral acts never in themselves effect a change in legal status because it is fundamental that a man cannot by his unilateral action affect the rights and interests of another except on the basis of statutory or other authority. rights and obligations are normally inter twined and a man cannot by abandonment per se of his rights and interests thereby rid himself of his own obligations or impose them on another.", "completion": "it does not appear to us quite convincing, without further argument, that the mere amendment of articles 158 and 178 can ipso facto alter the meaning which, as a result of a long series of judicial decisions of the different high courts in india, came to be attached to the language used in article 181.\n(2) 372 not, however, on this occasion, pursue the matter further, for we are of the,opinion that even if article 181 does apply to the present application it may still be said to be within time.\nthe period of limitation prescribed by that article is three years from the time when the right to apply accrues.\n(firm) vs nagappa chettiar(2) which was a suit to recover trust property from a person who had taken it, with notice of the trust, by a transaction which was a breach of trust, the privy council approved and applied the principles of the earlier indian decisions referred to therein to the case before them and held that the time began to run under article 120 after the plaintiff came to know of the transaction which gave him the right to sue.\nif article 181 applies then time began to run after the company came to know of its right to sue.\nif article 181 does not apply then the only article that can (1) (2) i.l.r. 373 apply by analogy is article 120 and the application is also within time."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: thus, there can be no abandonment of a tenancy except on statutory grounds (as, for example, in the central provinces tenancy act, 1920) unless there is acceptance, express or implied, by the other side. it may, for example in a case of tenancy, be to the landlord 's interest to keep the tenancy alive and so also in the case 374 of shares of a company. it may be to the interests of the company and the general body of shareholders to refrain from forfeiture if, for example, the value of unpaid calls exceeds the market value of the shares. such a position was envisaged in garden gully united quartz mining co. vs hugh mclister(1). so also with waiver. a long catena of illustrative cases will be found collected in b. b. mitra 's indian limitation act, thirteenth edition, pages 447 and 448. this fundamental concept brings about another repercussion. unless other circumstances intervene, there is a locus paenitentiae in which a unilateral abandonment or waiver can be recalled. it would be otherwise if the unilateral act of abandonment in itself, and without the supervention of other matters, effected a change in legal status. in point of fact, it is otherwise when, as in the statutory example i have quoted, the law intervenes and determines the tenancy. it is, therefore, in my opinion, fundamental that abandonment and waiver do not in themselves unilaterally bring about a change in legal status. something else must intervene, either a statutory mandate or an act of acceptance, express or implied, by another person, or, as lord chelmsford put it in clarke & chapman vs hart(1), acts which are equivalent to an agreement or a licence, or an estoppel in cases where an estoppel can be raised. next, there is, in my view, a fundamental difference between an executory interest and an executed one. in the former, it is necessary to resort to equitable reliefs to get enforced a right which is not at the date a vested right: cases of specific performance and declaration of a trust are examples, so also a prayer for relief from forfeiture. in cases of this kind, conduct which would disentitle a person to equitable relief is relevant. no hard and fast rule can or should be laid down as to what such conduct should consist of but among the varieties of conduct which courts have considered sufficient in this class of case is conduct which amounts to laches (1) at 57 (2) (1858) 10 e.r. 1443 at 1452 and 1453. 375 or where there has been a standing by or acquiescence or waiver or abandonment of a right, particularly when this would prejudicially affect third parties. this sort of distinction is brought out by lord chelmsford in clarke & chapman vs hart(1). the position is different when the interest is executed and the man has a vested interest in the right, that is to say, when he is the legal owner of the shares with the legal title to them residing in him. this legal title can only be destroyed in certain specified ways. it is in my view fundamental that the legal title to property, whether moveable or immoveable, cannot pass from one person to another except in legally recognised ways, and normally by the observance of certain recognised forms. confining myself to the present case, one of the ways in which the title to shares can pass is by forfeiture; but in that case an exact procedure has to be followed. a second way is by transfer which imports agreement. there again there is a regular form of procedure which must be gone through. a third is by estoppel, though, when the position is analysed, it will be found that it is not the estoppel as such which brings about the change. the expressions abandonment, waiver and so forth, when used in a case like the present, are only synonyms for estoppel and despite hallowed usage to the contrary, i prefer to call a spade a spade and put the matter in its proper legal pigeon hole and call it by its proper legal name. these other terms are, in my view, loose and inaccurate and tend to confuse, when applied to cases of the present nature. a man who has a vested interest and in whom the legal title lies does not, and cannot, lose that title by mere laches, or mere standing by or even by saying that he has abandoned his right, unless there is something more, namely inducing another party by his words or conduct to believe the truth of that statement and to act upon it to his detriment, that is to say, unless there is an estoppel, pure and simple. it is only in such a case that the right can (1) ; at 1452 and 1453. 376 be lost by what is loosely called abandonment or waiver, but even then it is not the abandonment or waiver as such which deprives him of his title but the estoppel which prevents him from asserting that his interest in the shares has not been legally extinguished, that is to say, which prevents him from asserting that the legal forms which in law bring about the extinguishment of his interest and pass the title which resides in him to another, were not duly observed. fazl ali j. and i endeavoured to explain this in dhiyan singh vs jugal kishore (1). what happens is this.", "completion": "it is, therefore, in my opinion, fundamental that abandonment and waiver do not in themselves unilaterally bring about a change in legal status.\nsomething else must intervene, either a statutory mandate or an act of acceptance, express or implied, by another person, or, as lord chelmsford put it in clarke & chapman vs hart(1), acts which are equivalent to an agreement or a licence, or an estoppel in cases where an estoppel can be raised.\nthe position is different when the interest is executed and the man has a vested interest in the right, that is to say, when he is the legal owner of the shares with the legal title to them residing in him.\nconfining myself to the present case, one of the ways in which the title to shares can pass is by forfeiture;

(madras) ltd. (1), after stating that building contracts could assume several forms, this court observed as follows: \"it is possible that the parties might enter into distinct and separate contracts, one for the transfer of materials for money consideration and other for the payment of remuneration for services and for work done. in such a case there are really two agreements, though there is a single instrument embodying them and the power of the state to separate the agreement of sale from the agreement to do work and render service and to impose a tax thereon, cannot be questioned and will stand untouched by the present judgment. \" the point for determination, therefore, is whether on its true construction, the contract in question is a combination of two distinct agreements, one to sell materials and the other to supply labour and services, or whether it, is only one agreement entire and indivisible for execution of the works. we will now refer to the relevant portion of the agreement dated december 19, 1953. the preamble to the agreement states that the owner had agreed with the contractor that the latter was to set up a complete coke oven battery ready for production as well as by products plants according to specifications given therein, that the installation was to be made at a site selected by the owner and that the contractor was to \"erect and construct buildings, plants and machineries and deliver and supply accessories and articles from germany and also locally from india and render services fully (1) ; 12 90 described in the first schedule. . for an all inclu sive price of rs. 2,31,50,000.\" then cl. i provides that the contractor shall execute and complete the works mentioned in the schedule, and el. 2 that the owner shall pay to the contractor for executing the contract the sum of rs. 2,31,50,000. clause 4 requires the contractor to \"provide all labour, materials, machinery, plant, tools, tackles and other implements for performing the works in a workman like manner. \" under cl. 11, the contractor guarantees \"to accomplish full production within 22 months from the 15th september, 1952\" and further undertakes to fulfill the guarantees prescribed in schedule ii to the agreement \"to the satisfaction of the owner within a period of three months from the date of accomplishment of full production. \" clause 28 provides that in case the contractor fails or is unable to complete the works within the period, the owner might take possession of the works and of the materials, \"which will become the property of the owner,\" and complete the works and deduct from the agreed price the expenses incurred in such completion. it is clear from the above clauses that the subject matter of the agreement was the installation of the coke oven battery and it accessories, that the sum of rs. 2,31,50,000 was the price agreed to be paid for the execution of those works, and that there was no agreement for the sale of materials, as such, by the appellants to the owner. in other words, the agreement in question is a contract entire and indivisible for the construction of specified works for a lump sum and not a contract of sale of materials as such.", "completion": "the learned judges then proceeded to observe: \"i wish, however, to state that i do not express any concluded opinion on the question whether there is sale of materials liable to be taxed in the present case.\nthe first question that arises for our decision is ,whether on the construction of the agreement dated december 19,1953, it could be held that there was a sale by the appellants of the materials used in the construction works, apart from the execution of those works.\nin such a case there are really two agreements, though there is a single instrument embodying them and the power of the state to separate the agreement of sale from the agreement to do work and render service and to impose a tax thereon, cannot be questioned and will stand untouched by the present judgment.\n2,31,50,000 was the price agreed to be paid for the execution of those works, and that there was no agreement for the sale of materials, as such, by the appellants to the owner.\nin other words, the agreement in question is a contract entire and indivisible for the construction of specified works for a lump sum and not a contract of sale of materials as such."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: now the contention that found favour with the learned judges in the high court was that there was in the contract a clause that the property in the, materials was to pass to the owner when they are brought on the site, and that, in effect, amounted to a sale of those materials by the appellant to the owner. the clause in question is as follows: \"15 (ii). all materials and plant brought by the contractor upon the site under the german and indian sections in connection with the construction 91 of the coke oven and by products plant shall immediately they are brought upon the site become the owner 's property and the same shall not on any account whatsoever be removed or taken away by the contractor or by any other person without the owner 's prior authority in writing. such of them as during the progress of the works will be rejected by the owner in accordance with the terms agreed upon between the contractor and the owner in this respect shall on such rejection, cease to be the owner 's property. . the owner shall not be liable for any loss or damage which may happen to or in respect of such materials and plant by the same being lost, stolen or injured or destroyed by fire, tempest or otherwise for which the contractor will be liable. . the owner agrees that after the coke oven and by products plants have been constructed according to the agreed terms, the contractor will be entitled to remove from the site their tools, tackles, machines, packing materials, protection roof and other materials as are surplus to the requirements of the normal operation of the coke oven and by products plant provided that no claim for increased cost is made in respect of anything so removed. \" in peare lal hagri singh vs the state of punjab (1), a building contract contained the following clause: \"all stores and materials brought to the site shall become and remain the, property of government and shall not be removed off the site without the prior written approval of the g. e. but whenever the works are finally completed, the contractor shall at his own expense forthwith remove from the site all surplus stores and materials originally sup plied by him and upon such removal, the same shall revest in and become the property of the contractor.\" discussing the question whether by reason of this clause there was a contract of sale of the materials by the contractor, distinct from the works contract, this court held that its object was only to ensure that (1) ; 92 materials of the right sort were used in the construction and not to constitute a contract of purchase of the materials separatism. in the present case, el. 15 is even clearer that no sale of materials, as such, was intended, because it expressly provides that if they were destroyed by fire, tempest or otherwise, the loss would fall not on the owner, which must be the result if the property is taken to have been absolutely transferred to it, but on the contractor. the argument based on section 9 of the is, in our opinion, equally unsound. what that section enacts is that where there is a contract of sale of movable but the price is not mentioned, it has to be fixed either in the manner provided in the agreement or by having regard to the course of dealings between the parties, and where that is not possible, the buyer has to pay the seller a reasonable price. but the section presupposes that there is a contract of sale of goods, and, as held in the state of madras v. gannon dunkerley & co. (madras) ltd. (1), such a contract requires that there must have been an agreement between the parties for the sale of the very goods in which eventually property passes. if, as held by us, cl. 15 does not embody an agreement for the sale of materials as such, there is no contract of sale with respect to them and section 9 of the can have no application. the contention, therefore, that el. 15 of the agreement could be read as amounting to a contract of sale of materials, and that the price therefor could be fixed as provided in section 9 of the by recourse to the account books of the appellants or the invoices or the course of dealings between them and the owner, must be rejected as untenable. it follows that the agreement dated december 19, 1953, being a contract for the construction of works, one and indivisible, the respondents have no right to impose a tax on the mate rials supplied in execution of that contract on the footing that such supply is a sale. it is next contended for the respondents that, whatever the merits of the contentions based on the construction of the contract, the proper forum to agitate (1) ; 93 them would be the authorities constituted under the act to hear and decide disputes relating to assessment of tax, that it was open to the appellants to satisfy those authorities that there have been no sales such as are liable to be taxed, that indeed they were bound to pursue the remedies under the act before they could invoke the jurisdiction of the court under article 226 and that the learned judges of the high court were, therefore, right in declining to entertain the present petitions.", "completion": "now the contention that found favour with the learned judges in the high court was that there was in the contract a clause that the property in the, materials was to pass to the owner when they are brought on the site, and that, in effect, amounted to a sale of those materials by the appellant to the owner.\nall materials and plant brought by the contractor upon the site under the german and indian sections in connection with the construction 91 of the coke oven and by products plant shall immediately they are brought upon the site become the owner 's property and the same shall not on any account whatsoever be removed or taken away by the contractor or by any other person without the owner 's prior authority in writing.\ne. but whenever the works are finally completed, the contractor shall at his own expense forthwith remove from the site all surplus stores and materials originally sup plied by him and upon such removal, the same shall revest in and become the property of the contractor.\" discussing the question whether by reason of this clause there was a contract of sale of the materials by the contractor, distinct from the works contract, this court held that its object was only to ensure that (1) ; 92 materials of the right sort were used in the construction and not to constitute a contract of purchase of the materials separatism.\n15 of the agreement could be read as amounting to a contract of sale of materials, and that the price therefor could be fixed as provided in section 9 of the by recourse to the account books of the appellants or the invoices or the course of dealings between them and the owner, must be rejected as untenable."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: it is true that if a statute sets up a tribunal and confides to it jurisdiction over certain matters and if a proceeding is properly taken before it in respect of such matters, the high court will not, in the exercise of its extraordinary jurisdiction under article 226, issue a prerogative writ so as to remove the proceedings out of the hands of the tribunal or interfere with their course before it. but it is equally well settled that, when proceedings are taken before a tribunal under a provision of law, which is ultra vires, it is open to a party aggrieved thereby to move the court under article 226 for issuing appropriate writs for quashing them on the ground that they are incompetent, without his being obliged to wait until those proceedings run their full course. that has been held by this court in the state of bombay vs the united motors (india) ltd. (1), himmatlal harilal mehta vs the state of madhya pradesh (2). and the bengal immunity company limited vs the state of bihar (3). the position that emerges is that, if the proceedings before the sales tax officer are founded on the provisions of the act, which authorizes the levy of the tax on the supply of materials in construction contracts, then they must in view of the decision in the state of madras vs gannon dunkerly & co. (madras) lid.

(2) ; , 1127. (3) , 617 619, 764 766. (4) ; 94 before the authorities under the act and the application under article 226 must fail. we must now examine the true scope of the proceedings before the sales tax officer in the light of the above principles. we start with this that the act contains provisions imposing a tax on the supply of materials under a construction contract. the appellants were indisputably engaged in construction works under the agreement dated december 19, 1953, and it is not suggested that they were carrying on any independent business as dealers in the state of bihar. presumably, therefore, when the sales tax authorities took proceedings against them, it was in respect of materials supplied by them under their contract dated december 19, 1953. when the appellants, in response to the notice issued by the third respondent, contested their liability to be taxed, it was on the ground that the supplies of materials under the contract were not sales. when the appellants next moved the court tinder article 226 for quashing the proceedings, they urged that the provisions of the act, in so far as they purported to impose a tax on the materials supplied in the performance of the contract, as if they were sold, were ultra vires. if the respondents sought to tax the appellants on the footing that sales of materials were effected outside the contract, it was their duty to have put that case forward in answer to the petition. they did nothing of the kind. they did not file even a counter statement. at the time of the argument, when faced with the decision of this court in the case of the state of madras vs gannon dunkerley & co. (madras) ltd. (1), their entire case was that the agreement between the parties should be construed as involving a sale of materials, and that their value could be ascertained from the invoices, account books and the course of dealings between the parties. no contention was urged that there were sales of materials which fell outside the agreement between the appellants and the owner. the learned judges of the high court in dismissing the petitions made it clear that the investigation before the sales (1) ; 95 tax authorities must be as regards their liability to pay sales tax \"upon proper construction of the contract. \" in this court also, the respondents seek in their statement to maintain the liability of the appellants only on the basis of the contract, reliance being placed on cl. 15 already referred to and on section 9 of the . there is no claim that the appellants are liable on the basis of sales falling outside the agreement. it was stated before us for the appellants, and not contradicted by the respondents, that the sindri fertilisers and chemicals (private) ltd., is a company controlled by the government. if that is so, the respondents were at all times in possession of facts which would have shown whether the appellants entered into any transaction decors the agreement, and it is significant that at no stage have they alleged any such facts. we are satisfied that the proceedings have at all stages gone on the footing that the liability of the appellants arose under the contract and not otherwise. in that view, we must hold, following the decision in the state of madras vs gannon dunkerley & co. (madras) ltd. (1) that the proceedings taken by the respondents for imposing sales tax on the supplies of materials by the appellants, pursuant to the contract dated december 19, 1953, are illegal and must be quashed. in the result, the appeals are allowed and appropriate writs as prayed for by the appellants will be issued. the appellants are entitled to their costs throughout. shah, j. in my view these appeals must fail.", "completion": "the position that emerges is that, if the proceedings before the sales tax officer are founded on the provisions of the act, which authorizes the levy of the tax on the supply of materials in construction contracts, then they must in view of the decision in the state of madras vs gannon dunkerly & co.\npresumably, therefore, when the sales tax authorities took proceedings against them, it was in respect of materials supplied by them under their contract dated december 19, 1953.\nwhen the appellants, in response to the notice issued by the third respondent, contested their liability to be taxed, it was on the ground that the supplies of materials under the contract were not sales.\nwhen the appellants next moved the court tinder article 226 for quashing the proceedings, they urged that the provisions of the act, in so far as they purported to impose a tax on the materials supplied in the performance of the contract, as if they were sold, were ultra vires.\nif the respondents sought to tax the appellants on the footing that sales of materials were effected outside the contract, it was their duty to have put that case forward in answer to the petition.\n\" in this court also, the respondents seek in their statement to maintain the liability of the appellants only on the basis of the contract, reliance being placed on cl.\n(1) that the proceedings taken by the respondents for imposing sales tax on the supplies of materials by the appellants, pursuant to the contract dated december 19, 1953, are illegal and must be quashed."}

(madras) ltd. (1) is not subject to sales tax. the act defines \"sale\" as meaning omitting parts not material any transfer of property in goods for (1) ; 96 cash or deferred payment or other valuable consideration, including a transfer of property in goods involved in the execution of contract. \"contract\" is defined as meaning any agreement for carrying out for cash or deferred payment or other valuable consideration, the construction, fitting out, improvement or repair of any building, road, bridge or other immovable property. the expression \"goods\" means all kinds of movable property other than actionable claims, stocks, shares or securities and includes all materials, articles and commodities whether or not to be used in the construction, fitting out, improvement or repair of immovable property. \"sale price\" means the amount payable to a dealer as valuable consideration for (1) the sale or supply of any goods, less any sum allowed as cash discount according to ordinary trade practice, but including any sum charged for anything done by the dealer in respect of the goods at the time of, or before, delivery thereof, other than the cost of freight or delivery or the cost of in stallation when such cost is separately charged;

97 sch. vii of the government of india act, 1935, to impose a tax on the supply of the materials used in such a contract treating it as a sale. relying upon the decision of this court in gannon dunkerley 's case (1), the appellants contend that the amount received by them under the contract dated december 19, 1953, is not liable to be assessed to sales tax. but the question whether the contract is a pure works contract or a composite contract has never been investi gated. undoubtedly, the formal document evidencing the contract suggests, prima facie, that it is a works contract, but in assessing liability to tax, the taxing authority is not restricted merely to the letter of the document: he has to enquire into the true nature of the transaction on all the relevant materials and to ascertain whether it partakes of the nature of the transaction which the statute renders taxable. he is, in ascertaining the true nature of the contract, also entitled to consider how the contract\"was performed. the act entrusts power to ascertain the facts on which the liability to tax depends to the taxing authorities and in that behalf, the act is exhaustive in scope and content. the appellants in approaching the high court by petitions under articles 226 and 227 of the constitution sought to eliminate the entire procedure and machinery set up by the act for ascertaining facts on which the liability to tax depends. i strongly deprecate the practice of the taxpayer being permitted to invoke the jurisdiction of the high court to issue high prerogative writs on certain assumed facts facts the truth of which has never been subjected to scrutiny in the only manner in which the law provides they should be scrutinised. the power to assess the facts on which the decision as to the true nature of the taxable transaction depends by the statute lies solely with the taxing authorities: it does not lie with any other body or tri bunal. invoking the jurisdiction of the high court to adjudicate upon the facts, directly or indirectly, on which the liability to tax depends, in my view, (1) ;

deputy custodian passed this order after he got an enquiry made through the revenue assistant (rehabilitation). the appel lants went in appeal to the additional custodian, evacuee property, who got further enquiry made to ascertain whether mumtaz, son of fakira, evacuee, had been in occupation of the house up to the date of the migration of the muslims as a result of the partition. this enquiry revealed that mumtaz had continued to reside in the village baland and that a son was born to him in july, 1947. the additional custodian therefore agreed with the report and the order of the deputy custodian that the property in suit was evacuee property. the appellants then filed a revision before the custodian general. it was dismissed on june 17, 1952. the custodian general observed that there was more than sufficient evidence to establish that mumtaz continued to be in possession of the house in dispute up to july, 1947. thereafter, the appellants filed a writ petition in the high

jurisdiction in the matter in view of the provisions of the wajibul arz according to which the house of a non proprietor, on his leaving the village, vested in the proprietory body. the learned single judge who heard the petition held that the provisions of the administration of the evacuee property act, 1950 (act xxxi of 1950), had been complied with throughout and referred the question whether the site occupied by a non proprietor vested or not in the custodian after the occupier had abandoned it, to a larger bench in view of his opinion that the decision of another single judge in joti parshad vs bhawani lal required re consideration. the division bench then decided this question and held the right of a non proprietor to occupy a village site was a right in property, though it might not be an interest in property and that this right vested in the custodian if the non proprietor left the country and became an evacuee. the writ petition was accordingly dismissed and it is against this order that this appeal has been filed. the sole question for determination in this case is whether fakira had any such right in the property in suit which could vest in the custodian on fakira or his son mumtaz becoming an evacuee. the case for the appellants is that fakira had no such right which could vest in the custodian both on account of the terms of the wajib ul arz and on account of his being a licensee. the respondents rely on section 18 of the to rebut this contention. it is necessary therefore to determine the scope of section is of the act. section 18, as originally enacted, was substituted by section 8 of act xi of 1953, which provided that the substituted section shall be deemed always to have been substituted for the original section. thus the present section must be deemed to be the section existing from the commencement of this act.", "completion": "this appeal, by special leave, is against the order of the punjab high court 153 dismissing the petition of the

vesting in the custodian under the provision of this act or to prevent the custodian from exercising all or any of the powers conferred on him by this act in respect of any such rights, and, notwithstanding anything containd in any such law, contract, instrument, decree, or order, neither the evacuee nor the custodian, whether as an occupancy tenant or as a tenant for a certain time, monthly or otherwise, of any land or house or other building shall be liable to be ejected or be deemed to have become so liable on any ground whatsoever for any default of (a) the evacuee committed after he became an evacuee or within a period of one year immediately preceding the date of his becoming an evacuee; or (b) the custodian.\" the expression 'occupancy rights ' has not been defined in the act. it is these occupancy rights which are not extinguished in spite of the provisions to the contrary in any other law or in any instrument having the force of law or in any decree or order of the court. the occasion when they will not be extinguished would be when a tenant becomes an 'evacuee ' within the meaning of the act, or thereafter. it follows that sub section (1) of section 18 provided for the non extinguishment of those occupancy rights which would have been extinguished otherwise on the tenant 's becoming an evacuee and that therefore the person having such rights must be a tenant. if he is not a tenant, then the occasion contemplated by sub section (1) of section 18, for the application of its provisions, does not arise. this is further clear from the latter part of this subsection which provides that notwithstanding anything contained in any law etc. , neither the evacuee nor the custodian, whether as an occupancy tenant or as a, 156 tenant for a certain time, shall be liable to be ejected or be deemed to have become so liable on any ground whatsoever for any default. this latter part also makes it clear that the persons contemplated by the section are the tenants, whether occupancy tenants or tenants for a certain time. we therefore hold that the provisions of section 18 apply to the occupancy rights of a tenant. the next question to determine is whether fakira was a tenant of this house. it is clear that fakira who resided in the house in suit, was not a tenant of it. he occupied the site and probably built the house himself on getting the necessary permission from the proprietors. with respect to non proprietors, the wajib ul arz of the village states: \"no non proprietor can settle in the village or build a house without the consent of the owner of the estate. whenever anybody settles, he obtains land or house from the proprietor of the same and he can live there so long as he pleases. whenever he abandons the village, if the house belongs to the shamlat ofit falls into the possession of that proprietorabout the houses of non proprietors . there isno customary right to sell or mortgage residential houses, remove the material or build burnt brick house without the consent of the proprietor if any person dies heirless his house reverts to the possession of the proprietor of the estate in which it is situate. \" the mendicants are mentioned as one of the types of non proprietors settled in the shamlat of the estate. it is clear from these provisions that fakira, a non proprietor, had no such right in the site as would make him a tenant of it. he just had a right to occupy it and build a house which was, however, heritable and transferable only with the consent of the proprietor. it follows, therefore, that the provisions of sub section (1) of section 18, do not apply to fakira 's rights in the plot in suit and cannot therefore over ride the provisions of the wajib ul arz according to which his right to 157 reside in the house in suit came to an end when he abandoned the village on his migrating to pakistan. learned counsel for the respondent has further contended that apart from section 18 of the act, fakira 's right to residence in the house in suit will vest in the custodian as his migrating from the village to pakistan on partition does not amount to abandonment contemplated by the provisions of the wajib ul arz. it is submitted that the wajib ul arz contemplates voluntary abandonment and not abandonment under force. we find it difficult to accept this contention. the abandonment is voluntary, though the volition to abandon arises on account of circumstances over which fakira bad no control. he left the village and migrated to pakistan because he thought that to be the better thing to do. this point was also not taken before the high court. reliance is placed on the case reported as associated hotels of india vs r. n.", "completion": "sub section (1) of section

(2)the real test is the intention of the parties whether they intended to create a lease or a licence. (3) if the document creates an interest in the property, it is a lease, but, if it only permits another to make use of the property, of which the legal possession continues with the owner, it is a licence, and (4) if under the document a party gets exclusive possession of the property, prima facie, he is considered to be a tenant, but circumstances may be established which negative that intention to create a lease. the terms of the wajib ul arz, already mentioned, make it clear that no interest in the site on which fakira was settled was given to fakira by the proprietors of the village. he was just granted a heritable (1) [1060] 1 s.c.r. 368,385, 158 right to occupy it for residence. the house reverted to the possession of the proprietors if he died heirless. learned counsel for the respondent has drawn our attention to the observation in the above case to the effect: \"the right of the respondent to transfer his interest under the document, although with the consent of the appellants, is destructive of any theory of licence. \" this observation does not help the respondent 's case because no interest was created in fakira and therefore no question of his transferring that interest arises. the wajib ul arz only expresses this much, that there was no customary right to sell or mortgage residential houses, remove the material or build burnt brick houses without the consent of the proprietors. it does not say that the non proprietor can transfer his residential right to any one with or without the consent of the proprietor. we therefore do not agree with this contention. it has also been contended for the respondent that the licensee 's rights which fakira bad, could vest in the custodian, as they come within the meaning of the expression 'property '. even if they do, those rights get extinguished in view of the provisions of the wajib ul arz and therefore there could be no vesting of those rights in the custodian if the vesting of those rights is not prevented on account of the applicability of section 18 of the act. we have already held that section 18 does not apply as fakira was not a tenant. the expression 'evacuee property ' as it stood in the act till its amendment in 1953, meant any property in which an evacuee had any right or interest, whether personal or as a trustee or as a beneficiary or in any other capacity and included any property etc. fakira had no right in any capacity in the property in suit when the came into force in 1950, and therefore the property in suit could not have been 'evacuee property '. lastly, we do not find any support in the provisions of the wajib ul arz or in any law for the observation in the judgment of the court below: 159 \"were the evacuee to come back he could demand to take possession of the site, and so it cannot be said that the right has ceased to exist. the right ceases only if the occupier leaves the village permanently with no intention of returning,. it was nobody 's case that fakira and his son had left the village temporarily and were to return. it was said in paragraph 5 of the written statement of respondents 1 to 3 that fakira abandoned the house only in 1947 at the time of partition. the entire case was that fakira had migrated to pakistan and had abandoned the village. we are therefore of opinion that fakira did not possess any such right in the land in suit which could vest in the custodian and that therefore the property in suit is not 'evacuee property '. we therefore allow the appeal with costs throughout and, setting aside the order of the court below, allow the petition and quash the order of the custodian general dated june 17, 1952, declaring the property in suit to be evacuee property. appeal allowed.", "completion": "learned counsel for the respondent has drawn our attention to the observation in the above case to the effect: \"the right of the respondent to transfer his interest under the document, although with the consent of the appellants, is destructive of any theory of licence.\nit has also been contended for the respondent that the licensee 's rights which fakira bad, could vest in the custodian, as they come within the meaning of the expression 'property '.\nfakira had no right in any capacity in the property in suit when the came into force in 1950, and therefore the property in suit could not have been 'evacuee property '.\nlastly, we do not find any support in the provisions of the wajib ul arz or in any law for the observation in the judgment of the court below: 159 \"were the evacuee to come back he could demand to take possession of the site, and so it cannot be said that the right has ceased to exist.\nwe are therefore of opinion that fakira did not possess any such right in the land in suit which could vest in the custodian and that therefore the property in suit is not 'evacuee property '."}

(2) whether the claim in the suit was not barred by limitation. the argument on this second 327 point was that if article 83 of the indian limitation act governed the claim it would be barred, and that the provision contained in article 149 prescribing a 60 year period of limitation for suits by the government was si, unconstitutional as violative of article 14 of the consti tution. it is this last plea that has led to the appeal being heard by this larger bench. as regards the first point that the suit claim was not comprehended within the terms of the security bond, learned counsel made three submissions: (1) in order to render the defendants liable, the loss sustained by the government must be proved to have occured on or after march 6, 1940 on which date alone lal chand kothari took charge of the treasury. though loss to the extent set out in the plaint did occur at the treasury in beawar, learned counsel urged, the plain. tiff respondent had not proved that it occurred after march 6, 1940.", "completion": "this is an appeal on a certificate granted by the judicial commissioner, ajmer, and is directed against the judgment of that court dated december 16, 1954 by which the decree in favour of the respondent union of india was affirmed.\nseth lal chand kothari the original first appellant in the appeal before us (he died pending this appeal and his heirs have been brought on record as his legal representatives appellants 1 to 6) was appointed by the commissioner ajmer merwara as government treasurer, ajmer merwara, by an order dated february 20, 1940, the treasuries to be under his charge being two that at ajmer and a subtreasury at beawar.\n60,000 and also execute a security bond for a like amount with two sureties to cover any loss to the government in these treasuries.\nhe accordingly made the deposit, and a security bond was executed by him on february 27, 1940 with seth phool chand who is now the 7th appellant in the appeal and one seth kanwarlal ranka who died even before the suit and was not impleaded in it.\nthere were two cash chests at this sub treasury one secured with a single lock, the key of which was with the staff of the treasurer and the other with doublelocks, the keys of which were held, one by the emplo yee of the treasurer and the other by the government treasury officer the tahsildar.\nthe union of india thereupon filed a suitcivil suit 125 of 1951 before the sub judge first class, beawar on the security bond dated february 27, 1940 against lal chand kothari and seth phool chand for recovery of this sum.\nthe defendants filed an appeal to the judicial commissioner who dismissed it, but having regard to the fact that some of the defences turned on the interpretation of the security bond dated february 27, 1940, granted a certificate under article 133(1) of the constitution and that is how the appeal is now before us.\nas regards the first point that the suit claim was not comprehended within the terms of the security bond, learned counsel made three submissions: (1) in order to render the defendants liable, the loss sustained by the government must be proved to have occured on or after march 6, 1940 on which date alone lal chand kothari took charge of the treasury."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: in other words, the argument was that there was no physical checking on march 6, 1940 when he took over and because of this one could not be certain whether it was a loss which had occurred during the period of the previous incumbent in office or could with certainty be attributed to the period subsequent to march 6, 1940. this argument was rejected by the courts below and, in our opinion, correctly. in the face of the receipt executed by lal chand kothari it would not be open to him to contend that the recitals in it were not correct, and in any event it would be for him to show that it was incorrect and, of course, there was no possibility of his establishing this. (2) it was next urged that on the terms of the bond read in the context of the surrounding circumstances lal chand kothari would be liable only for the deficiency in the chest with the single lock and not for the loss or embezzlement or deficiency in the other chest with the double lock. the whole basis of this argument was that the security deposit of rs. 60,000 and the security bond for the like amount executed by the treasurer was an indication that it was with reference to the amount which was the maximum in the chest under the single lock and from this feature it was 328 urged that it was the intention of the parties that lal chand kothari would not be responsible for any embezzlement, loss or deficiency in the other chest. this submission is without any foundation, because the liability under the bond would depend upon its terms and in the face of the language used in the document learned counsel realised that the submission could not be seriously maintained. (3) the last submission under this head was that the loss having occurred in the chest with the doublelock, this could not have been without the connivance of government officials and that therefore the liability of the treasurer was excluded. learned counsel also drew our attention to the fact that the terms of the bond made lal chand liable even for embezzlement by government officers, notwithstanding that he had no control over them. but if lal chand agreed to those terms and this is not disputed, the terms must pre vail. apart from the terms of the security bond however, it would be apparent that if the key of one of the locks was with the employee of the treasurer the defecation could not have occurred without such employee 's connivance or negligence. if so, the fixing of liability upon the employer could not be characterised even as unreasonable apart from the liability flowing from the terms of the bond, and such a vicarious liability for the negligence or misconduct of his servants, is not lessened by reason of the assistance or negligence of government officials. these exhaust the points urged based on the terms of the bond. it remains to deal only with the contention that the claim is barred by limitation under article 83 of the limitation act on the plea that article 149 of the limitation act which fixes a period of 60 years for suits by the government is unconstitutional as violating article 14 of the constitution. it is urged that there is no rational basis for treating claims by government differently from those of private individuals in the matter of the time within which they could be enforced by suit. learned counsel urged that statutes of limitation were statutes of repose and enacted to ensure that stale 329 claims were not agitated, so that after a reasonable length of time people might proceed on the footing that they would not be held liable for possible claims against them. basing himself on these principles, the argument of the learned counsel was that for the purpose of agitating claims no distinction could be drawn between government and private ' individuals and that on no rational basis could a legislation which permitted a longer period of limitation for claims by the state be sustained. it is, no doubt, true that lord kenyon described statutes of limitation as \"statutes of repose\" (vide per dallas, c. j. in tolson vs kaye (1)) and bramwell, b. as \"statutes of peace\" (hunter vs oibbons (2)), though sometimes contrary opinions have been expressed. in re baker (3), cotton, l. j. observed that pleas of limitation would never be looked upon with any favour since they are used to defeat debts clearly due. it is however unnecessary to examine further the theory underlying statutes of limitation. we shall proceed on the generally accepted basis that they are designed to effectuate a beneficent public purpose, viz. to prevent the taking away from one what he has for long been permitted to consider his own and on the faith of which he plans his life,, habits and expenses. this however does not militate against there being a rational basis for a distinction being drawn between the claims of the state and the claims of the individual in the matter of a provision of a bar of limitation for enforcing them. in considering this matter two points have to be kept separate: (1) whether a distinction could be drawn or a classification supported between the provision of any variation in the time that should be available for enforcing claims by private individuals and claims by the state, (2) whether, if such a classification were good, the period of 60 years provided by article 149 of the indian limitation act is such a long period of time as to be unreasonable.", "completion": "(2) it

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: we are drawing attention to the distinction between these two points because learned counsel laid (1) , 223: ; , 126g. (2) ; , 5. (3) , 270. 330 much stress on the fact that the period, of limitation fixed by article 149 was 60 years and that this was an unreasonably long period of time. if learned counsel is right in his submission that there is no rational basis for placing private individuals and the government in different classes while framing a legislation providing for limitation for actions he might succeed; but if he is wrong there and the correct view is that there is a rational basis of classification, then the period that should be allowed to the government to file a suit would be a matter of legislative policy and could not be brought within the scope or purview of a challenge under article 14 or indeed of any other article in the constitution. it is sufficient therefore if we confine ourselves to the first point, viz., whether there is a rational basis for treating the government differently as regards the period within which claims might be put in suit between the government on the one hand and private individuals on the other. first and foremost there is this feature that the limitation act, though a statute of repose and intended for quieting titles, and in that sense looks at the problem from the point of view of the defendant with a view to provide for him a security against stale claims, addresses itself at the same time also to the position of the plaintiff. thus, for instance, where the plaintiff is under a legal disability to institute a suit by reason of his being a minor or being insane or an idiot, it makes provisions for. the extension of the period taking into account that disability. similarly, public interest in a claim being protected is taken into account by section 10 of the act by providing that there shall be no period of limitation in the case of express trusts. it is not necessary to go into the details of these provisions but it is sufficient to state that the approach here is from the point of view of protecting the enforceability of claims which, if the ordinary rules applied, would become barred by limitation. it is in great part on this principle that it is said that subject to statutory provision, while the maxim vigilantibus et non dormientibus jura subveniunt is a rule for the subject, the maxim nullum tempus occurit regi 331 is in general applicable to the crown. the reason assigned was, to quote coke, that the state ought not to suffer for the negligence of its officers or for their fraudulent collusion with the adverse party. it is with this background that the question of the special provision contained in article 149 of the act has to be viewed. first, we have the fact that in the case of the government, if a claim becomes barred by limitation, the loss falls on the public, i.e., on the community in general and to the benefit of the private individual who derives advantage by the lapse of time. this itself would appear to indicate a sufficient ground for differentiating between the claims of an individual and the claims of the community at large. next, it may be mentioned that in the case of governmental machinery, it is a known fact that it does not move as quickly as in the case of individuals. apart from the delay occurring in the proper officers ascertaining that a cause of action has accrued government being an impersonal body, before a claim is launched there has to be inter departmental correspondence, consultations, sanctions obtained according to the rules. these necessarily take time and it is because of these features which are sometimes characterised as red tape that there is delay in the functioning of government offices. it is precisely for this reason that we have from the earliest civil procedure codes provisions which find place in the code of 1908, like o.27,rr.5 and 7 reading: \"0. 27. the court in fixing the day for the government to answer to the plaint, shall allow a reasonable time for the necessary communication with the government through the proper channel, and for the issue of instructions to the government pleader to appear and answer on behalf of the government and may extend the time at its discretion. 0. 27. r. 7(1). where the defendant is a public officer and, in receiving the summons, considers it proper to make a reference to the government before answering the plaint, he may apply to the court to 332 grant such extension of the time fixed in the summons as may be necessary to enable him to make such reference and to receive orders thereon through the proper channel. (2) upon such application the court. shall extend the time for so long as appears to it to be necessary. \" these matters apart, the ratio underlying the special provisions for summary recovery of amounts due to government without resort to suits by a procedure not available for enforcing the dues of private individuals, like the \"revenue recovery acts\" and \"public demands recovery acts\" which, have been on the statute book for over a century is also similar, viz., the interest of the public and of the community in realising what is due to it expeditiously; and the constitutional validity of such provisions have been sustained by this court.", "completion": "if learned counsel is right in his submission that there is no rational basis for placing private individuals and the government in different classes while framing a legislation providing for limitation for actions he might succeed; but if he is wrong there and the correct view is that there is a rational basis of classification, then the period that should be allowed to the government to file a suit would be a matter of legislative policy and could not be brought within the scope or purview of a challenge under article 14 or indeed of any other article in the constitution.\nit is sufficient therefore if we confine ourselves to the first point, viz., whether there is a rational basis for treating the government differently as regards the period within which claims might be put in suit between the government on the one hand and private individuals on the other.\nfirst, we have the fact that in the case of the government, if a claim becomes barred by limitation, the loss falls on the public, i.e., on the community in general and to the benefit of the private individual who derives advantage by the lapse of time.\n\" these matters apart, the ratio underlying the special provisions for summary recovery of amounts due to government without resort to suits by a procedure not available for enforcing the dues of private individuals, like the \"revenue recovery acts\" and \"public demands recovery acts\" which, have been on the statute book for over a century is also similar, viz., the interest of the public and of the community in realising what is due to it expeditiously; and the constitutional validity of such provisions have been sustained by this court."}

respectively to the areas specified in schs. i and ii to the act, and shall continue to extend to any such area, notwithstanding that the area ceased to be of the description therein specified. by sub section (3), the state government was authorised, by notification in the official gazette, to extend to any other area, any or all the provisions of part ii or part iii or of both. it would appear from this that parts i and iv came into operation throughout the territories of the pre reorganisation state of bombay. part ii came to be extended to this area by the notification, and after that extension, parts 1, 11 and iv of the act began to apply, while the suit was pending. we are not concerned in this appeal with part 111. the contention on behalf of the appellants is that by the latter part of the proviso to section 50, relevant portions of which have been quoted earlier, all the provisions of part ii were extended to this area, and that all pending suits and proceedings were governed, no matter when filed. the notification extending part ii of the act to this area had, it is contended, also the same effect independently of the first proviso to section 50. it is contended, therefore, that sub section (1) of section 12, which prohibits a landlord from recovering possession of any premises so long as the tenant pays or is ready and willing to pay the amount of the standard rent and permitted increases, if any, and is also observing the other conditions of the tenancy in so far as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of the act, applies to the present case and the tenants are protected. it is also contended that if the first proviso to section 50 was limited to such suits only as were pending on the date of the passing of the act, section 12(1), on its own terms, is applicable to the present case, and being retrospective in character, leads to the same result. these two contentions were apparently raised in the court of the civil judge and before the high 165 court. the high court, however, ruled that section 12 was prospective in character and did not apply to pending suits or proceedings. it is contended by the learned attorney general what the construction placed by the high court upon the first proviso to section 50 is erroneous. though he section concedes that the proviso must be read as qualifying what the substantive part of section 50 enacts, he urges that the proviso goes beyond that purpose and enacts a substantive law of its own. he relies upon the following observations of lord loreburn, l. c., in rhondda urban council vs taff vale railway (1), where a pro viso to section 51 of the railway clauses consolidation act, 1845, was under consideration: \"it is true that section 51 is framed as a proviso upon preceding sections. but it is also true that the latter half of it, though in form a proviso, is in substance a fresh enactment, adding to and not merely qualifying that which goes before.\", and contends that the latter portion of the proviso, in question, being a substantive enactment, comprehends not only those suits which were pending on the date of repeal but also those cases, which came within the language of the latter part of the proviso, whenever the act was extended to new areas.", "completion": "in any case where there is a dis pute as to the amount of standard rent or permitted

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: on behalf of the landlord, the learned solicitor general argues that the proviso should be read as a proviso only to the substantive enactment, and must be taken to qualify the substantive portion of section 50 only to the extent to which it makes an exception to the repeal and but for the proviso would be governed by the repealed acts. he relies upon craies on statute law, 5th edn., pp.201 202, where the following passage occurs: \"the effect of an excepting or qualifying proviso, according to the ordinary rules of construction, is to except out of the preceding portion of the enactment, or to qualify something enacted therein, which but for the proviso would be within it and such a proviso cannot be construed as enlarging the scope of an enactment when it can be fairly and (1) , 258.166 properly construed without attributing to it that effect. \" he also relies upon the following observations of lush, j., in mullins vs treasurer of surrey (1): \"when one finds a proviso to a section, the natural presumption is that, but for the proviso, the enacting part of the section would have included the subject matter of the proviso.\" the law with regard to provisos is well settled and well understood. as a general rule, a proviso is added to an enactment to qualify or create an exception to what is in the enactment, and ordinarily, 'a proviso is not interpreted as stating a general rule. but, provisos are often added not as exceptions or qualifications to the main enactment but as savings clauses, in which cases they will not be construed as controlled by the section. the proviso which has been added to section 50 of the act deals with the effect of repeal. the substantive part of the section repealed two acts which were in force in the state of bombay. if nothing more had been said, section 7 of the bombay general clauses act would have applied, and all pending suits and proceedings would have continued under the old law, as if the repealing act had not been passed. the effect of the proviso was to take the matter out of section 7 of the bombay general clauses act and to provide for a special saving. it cannot be used to decide whether section 12 of the act is retrospective. it was observed by wood, v. c., in fitzgerald vs champneys(2) that saving clauses are seldom used to construe acts. these clauses are introduced into acts which repeal others, to safeguard rights which, but for the savings, would be lost. the proviso here saves pending suits and proceedings, and further enacts that suits and proceedings then pending are to be transferred to the courts designated in the act and are to continue under the act and any or all the provisions of the act are to apply to them. the learned solicitor general contends that the savings clause enacted by the proviso, even if treated as substantive law, must be taken to (1) , 173.(2) ; e.r. 958.167 apply only to suits and proceedings pending at the time of the repeal which, but for the proviso, would be governed by the act repealed. according to the learned attorney general, the effect of the savings is much wider, and it applies to such cases as come within the words of the proviso, whenever the act is extended to new areas. these arguments are interesting, and much can be said on both bides, particularly as the legislature has by a subsequent amendment changed the proviso. but, in our opinion, they need not be considered in this case, in view of what we have decided on the second point. the second contention urged by the learned attorney general that section 12(1) applied from the date on which the act was extended to the area in question is, in our opinion, sound. section 12(1) enacts a rule of decision, and it says that a landlord is not entitled to possession if the tenant pays or shows his readiness and willingness to pay the standard rent and to observe the other conditions of the tenancy. the word \"tenant\" is defined in the act to include not only a tenant, whose tenancy subsists but also any person remaining, after the determination of the lease, in possession with or without the assent of the landlord. the present appellants, as statutory tenants, were within the rule enacted by section 12(1) and entitled to its protection, if the sub section could be held applicable to this suit. both the bombay high court and this court had, on the previous occasions, observed that section 12 of the act was prospective. in those cases, the learned judges were concerned with the interpretation of sub sections (2) and (3) only, which, as the words of those subsections then existing show, were clearly prospective, and were applicable to suits to be instituted after the coming into force of the act. but a section may be prospective in some parts and retrospective in other parts. while it is the ordinary rule that substantive rights should not be held to be taken away except by express provision or clear implication, many acts, though prospective in form, 168 have been given retrospective operation, if the intention of the legislature is apparent. this is more so, when acts are passed to protect the public against some evil or abuse.

(1) the court shall, when passing any decree or order on the grounds specified in clause (f) or clause (g) of the proviso to sub section (1) of section 13, ascertain from the tenant whether he elects to be placed in occupation of the promises or part thereof from which he is to be evicted and if the tenant so elects, shall record the fact of the election in the decree or order and specify therein the date on or before which he shall deliver possession so as to enable the landlord to commence the work of repairs or building or re building as the case may be.

(1) notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, no person who has obtained any decree or order for the eviction of a tenant from any building in a slum area shall be entitled to execute such decree or order except with the previous permission in writing of the competent authority.

(4) where the competent authority refuses to grant the permission it shall record a brief statement of the reasons for such refusal and furnish a copy thereof to the applicant. \" the other change in the law was that due to the enactment of rules and regulations providing for a coordinated development and planning of buildings in the delhi area the type of constructions that could be sanctioned by the delhi municipal committee underwent a radical alteration as a result of which in the area now in question double storeyed buildings were not permitted to be constructed and that if the petitioner 's house had to be reconstructed it could only have three living rooms making allowance for the size of the rooms and the free space that had to be left on either side of the building in accordance with the revised municipal regulations. it would have been noticed that the right of the tenants to insist on the landlord providing accommodation for them in the reconstructed building guaranteed to them by section 15 of the rent control act, had ceased by reason of their failure to quit and deliver vacant possession of the tenements occupied by them within 3 months fixed by the order of the civil court (vide section 15) and hence they had no statutory right under the rent control act to be provided with accommodation by the landlord. thus freed from obligation to the tenants the petitioner filed on the strength of these decrees for eviction nine applications under section 19 of the act before the competent authority for the eviction of the tenants from the nine rooms in the building on the ground that the building had to be reconstructed as it was in a dilapidated condition. these petitions were dismissed by the competent authority by his order dated january 13, 1958 on the ground that the sanction to 132 reconstruct the building which the petitioner had obtained from the municipality in 1956 had expired. the order recited: \"since it may take some time for the petitioner to obtain fresh sanction for reconstruction and there is also the possibility of sanction not being given at all, it would be no use continuing with these proceedings until it is definitely known that the landlord has obtained sanction for reconstruction. these nine applications are accordingly filed with the option to the petitioner to have them revived without payment of extra fee in case he is able to obtain sanction. \" thereafter the petitioner applied to the municipal authorities for sanctioning a building plan. as stated earlier, the building plan approved by the municipality could permit only a building consisting of one floor in which there were three living rooms and sanction for the construction of a building with such accommodation was granted. with this sanctioned plan, the petitioner renewed his application under section 19 for permission to execute the decree of the civil court and evict the tenants. by order dated july 30, 1958 all these applications were dismissed. the reason assigned for the order was stated in these terms: \"if the decree is allowed to be executed they will be thrown out and it will be impossible for them to get accommodation in the reconstructed building. they are old tenants and as stated above also very poor. the execution of the decree will involve very real hardship to them. they are all occupying only one kothri each and paying rent at rs. 3 per mensem, and they have no complaint to make about the condition of their kothries. the landlord has four or five other houses which he has let out on rent. the case has a human aspect and i disallow the execution of the decree against the tenants. \" the petitioner preferred appeals against this order to the administrator of the union territory, delhi to whom appeals lay under section 20 of the act. the appeals were dismissed, the appellate authority saying : 133 \"i would have allowed the appellant permission to evict the tenants, if the property itself was dilapidated and declared unfit for human habitation by a competent authority. this is not so.", "completion": "(1) notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, no

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: the land lord naturally desires to get a better return from land in the congested areas of the city by rebuilding on it to better specifications, so that he can get higher rent from it. but if this tendency is permitted to have an unrestricted play, then the result will be the eviction of a large number of poor people from slum areas. in the circumstances, the appellant should wait until either his property is declared dangerous by the municipal corporation, or under a slum clearance scheme he is asked by the competent authority itself to demolish it or rebuild it in a particular manner. \" in these circumstances the petitioner has moved this court for the issue of a writ of certiorari to quash these orders on the ground already adverted to, viz., that section 19 of the act is invalid and unconstitutional as violative of the petitioner 's rights guaranteed by articles 14 and 19(1)(f) of the constitution. in passing we may observe that we are not concerned with the validity of the particular orders passed in the case but only with the general question as to the constitutionality of the impugned section 19 of the act. before setting out the points urged by mr. narula learned counsel for the petitioners in support of his submission that section 19 of the act\" was, in so far as it enabled the competent authority to withhold permission to those who had obtained decrees for eviction from executing their decrees, unconstitutional, it would be necessary to read the material provisions of the rent control act, 1952, which imposes a restriction on the right of landlords, inter alia to evict tenants from the premises occupied by them. chapter iii of that act imposes a control over the eviction of tenants. a tenant is defined (vide section 2(j)) as meaning \"any person by whom or on whose account rent is payable for any premises including such sub tenants or others who have derived title under the tenant 134 under the provisions of any law before the commencement of the act. \" section 13(1) enacts: \"notwithstanding anything to the contrary con tained in any other law or any contract, no decree or order for the recovery of possession of any premises shall be passed by any court in favour of the landlord against any tenant (including a tenant whose tenancy is terminated):\". this blanket protection is, however, subject to the conditions enumerated in the proviso which reads: \"provided that nothing in this sub section shall apply to any suit or other proceeding for such recovery of possession if the court is satisfied \" then follow ten grounds the existence of one or other of which enables a landlord to obtain a decree from a civil court for the recovery of possession from tenants. among the grounds thus enumerated it is sufficient to refer to grounds (f), (g) and (1), ground (g) being the ground upon which the petitioner in the present case obtained the decrees for eviction and these run: \" (f) that the premises have become unsafe or unfit for human habitation and are bona fide required by the landlord for carrying out repairs which cannot be carried out without the premises being vacated; or (g) that the premises are bona fide required by the landlord for the purpose of re building the premises or for the replacement of the promises by any building or for the erection of other buildings, and that such building or rebuilding cannot be carried out without the premises being vacated; or (1) that the landlord requires the premises in order to carry out any building work at the instance of the government or the delhi improvement trust in pursuance of any improvement scheme or development scheme. \" the right of the landlord, however, who obtains an order for eviction under either cl. (f) or (g) above set out is subject to the provisions of section 15 whose terms have already been set out, the result, therefore, 135 would be that in the cases covered by these two clauses the tenants would be entitled, if they conform to the terms of these provisions, to be reinstated in the newly constructed premises after the reconstruction. it might be pointed out that under section 38 of the rent control act the provisions of the act and the rules made thereunder are to have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force. the argument of the learned counsel was that the restriction upon the rights of landlords to the enjoyment of the property imposed by section 13 of the rent control act could not be open to any objection, legal or constitutional because the legislature has set out with precision the grounds upon which possession could be recovered, the defenses that might be set up by the tenants and the conditions subject to which the rights either of the landlord or of the tenant could be exercised. it is the super imposition of the provisions of section 19 of the act on the rights of a landlord decreeholder who had satisfied the requirements of the rent control act before obtaining his decree that was stated as amounting to an unreasonable restriction on the right to hold property guaranteed by article 19(1)(f). this will be a convenient stage at which we might set out in brief outline the argument urged by learned counsel for the petitioner.", "completion": "narula learned counsel for the petitioners in support of his submission that section 19 of the act\" was, in so far as it enabled the competent authority to withhold permission to those who had obtained decrees for eviction from executing their decrees, unconstitutional, it would be necessary to read the material provisions of the rent control act, 1952, which imposes a restriction on the right of landlords, inter alia to evict tenants from the premises occupied by them.\nthe argument of the learned counsel was that the restriction upon the rights of landlords to the enjoyment of the property imposed by section 13 of the rent control act could not be open to any objection, legal or constitutional because the legislature has set out with precision the grounds upon which possession could be recovered, the defenses that might be set up by the tenants and the conditions subject to which the rights either of the landlord or of the tenant could be exercised.\nit is the super imposition of the provisions of section 19 of the act on the rights of a landlord decreeholder who had satisfied the requirements of the rent control act before obtaining his decree that was stated as amounting to an unreasonable restriction on the right to hold property guaranteed by article 19(1)(f)."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: they were mainly three: (1) section 19(3) of the act vests an unguided, unfettered and uncontrolled power in an executive officer to withhold permission to execute a decree which a landlord has obtained after satisfying the reasonable requirements of the law as enacted in the rent control act. neither section 19 of the act nor any other provision of the act indicates the grounds on which the competent authority might grant or withhold permission to execute decrees and the power conferred is, therefore, arbitrary and offends article 14 of the constitution. (2) the same point was urged in a slightly different form by saying that the power conferred on the \"competent authority\" by section 19(3) of the act was an excessive delegation of legislative power and was, therefore, unconstitutional. (3) the 136 vesting of a power in an executive authority to override at his sweet will and pleasure rights to property without any guidance from the legislature con stituted an unreasonable restraint on the petitioner 's right to hold property, a right which in the case of the property of the type now in question would include a right to obtain possession from the tenant in order either to improve it by reconstruction or for the purpose of his own use. apart from the objection regarding the vesting of an unguided power in an executive authority which is, the common ground of objection urged in regard to points (1) and (2), learned counsel submitted that the right vested in an executive authority to prevent for an indefinite and indeterminate period of time the right to enjoy his property was for this further reason excessive and an unreasonable restraint which could not be justified under article 19(5) of the constitution. we shall proceed to consider these points in that order. the first ground alleged is that section 19 of the act is constitutionally invalid as violative of the equal protection of the laws conferred under article 14 of the constitution, in that an unguided and arbitrary discretion is vested in the \"competent authority\". the import, content and scope of article 14 of the constitution has been elaborately considered and explained in numerous decisions of this court and it is, therefore, unnecessary for us to embark on any fresh investigation of the topic, but it would be sufficient to summarise the principles, or rather the rules of guidance for the interpretation of the article which have already been established, and then consider the application of those rules to the provisions of the enactment now impugned. it is only necessary to add that the decisions of this court laying down the proper construction of article 14 rendered up to 1959 have been summarised in the form of 5 propositions by das c. j. in ramakrishna dalmia vs justice tendolkar (1), but we are making a summary on slightly different lines more relevant to the enquiry regarding the provision with which we are concerned in the present case. (1) ; , 299, 301 137 (1) if the statute itself or the rule made under it applies unequally to persons or things similarly situated, it would be an instance of a direct violation of the constitutional guarantee and the provision of the statute or the rule in question would have to be struck down. (2) the enactment or the rule might not in terms enact a discriminatory rule of law but might enable an unequal or discriminatory treatment to be accorded to persons or things similarly situated. this would happen when the legislature vests a discretion in an authority, be it the government or an administrative official acting either as an executive officer or even in a quasi judicial capacity by a legislation which does not lay down any policy or disclose any tangible or intelligible purpose, thus clothing the authority with unguided and arbitrary powers enabling it to discriminate. \"the legislature must declare the policy of the law and the legal principles which are to control any given cases and must provide a standard to guide the officials or the body in power to execute the law. the essential legislative function consists in the determination or choice of the legislative policy and of formally enacting that policy into a binding rule of conduct.\" [harishankar bagla vs the state of madhya pradesh (1)]. \"no rules have been framed and no directions given on these matters to regulate or guide the discretion of the licensing officer. practically the order commits to the unrestrained will of a single individual the power to grant, withhold or cancel licences in any way he chooses and there is nothing in the order which could ensure a proper execution of the power or operate as a check upon injustice that might result from improper execution of the same\".

are sought to be carried out by chapters ii to vi of the enactment. chapter 11 which consists of one sections. 3 provides a definition of what are \"slum areas\" and their declaration as such. the tests for determining whether the area could be declared a \"slum area\" or not briefly are whether the buildings in the area are (a) unfit for human habitation, or (b) are by reason of dilapidation, overcrowding etc. detrimental to safety, health or morals. it is in areas so declared as \"slum areas\" that the rest of the enactment is to operate. the provisions, however, make it clear that in order that an area may be declared a \" slum area\" every building in that area need not be unfit for human habitation or that human habitation in every building in such area should be detrimental to the safety, health or morals of the dwellers. we are making this observation because of a suggestion 142 made, that the declared purpose of protecting the tenants from eviction was inconsistent with the policy underlying the declaration of an area as a \"slum area\" and that thus the act manifested two contrary or con flicting ideas or principles which would negative each other and thus leave no fixed policy to guide \" the competent authority\" when exercising his powers to grant or refuse eviction when an application was made to him in that behalf under section 19 of the act. chapter iii is headed 'slum improvement ' and makes provision for two types of orders: (1) to require the improvement of buildings where repairs major or minor would make them reasonably habitable for the slum dwellers (vide sections 4 6), and (2) cases where mere repairs or adjustments would not suffice but what is required is the demolition of the entire building. in the latter case certainly the occupants of the building would have to be evicted and the building vacated and power is conferred for effectuating this purpose vide section 7 (1) and 7 (3). it might be that the whole area might consist of dwellings of the type which require demolition and it is chapter iv that makes provision for this category of cases which is headed \"slum clearance and re development\". in such cases the buildings in the entire area are to be ordered to be demolished, and in that event the dwellers would, of course, have to vacate, but it is presumed that alternative accommodation would necessarily have to be provided before any such order is made. the process would have to be carried out in an orderly fashion if the purpose of the act is to be fulfilled and the policy behind it, viz., the establishment of slum dwellers in healthier and more comfortable tenements so as to improve the health and morals of the community, is to be achieved. chapter v makes provision for the acquisition of land in order to compass the re development of slum areas into healthy parts of the city, by providing amenities and more substantial and better accommodation for the previous inhabitants. it is after this that we have chapter vi whose terms we have already set out. this chapter is headed \"protection of tenants in slum areas 143 from eviction\". obviously, if the protection that is afforded is read in the context of the rest of the act, it is clear that it is to enable the poor who have no other place to go to, and who if they were compelled, to go out, would necessarily create other slums in the a process and live perhaps in less commodious and more unhealthy surroundings than those from which they were evicted, to remain in their dwellings until provision is made for a better life for them elsewhere. though therefore the act fixes no time limit during which alone the restraint on eviction is to operate, it is clear from the policy and purpose of the enactment and the object which it seeks to achieve that this restriction would only be for a period which would be determined by the speed with which the authorities are able to make other provisions for affording the slum dweller tenants better living conditions.", "completion": "the provisions, however, make it clear that in order that an area may be declared a \" slum area\" every building in that area need not be unfit for

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: the act, no doubt, looks at the problem not from the point of view of the landlord, his needs, the money he has sunk in the house and the possible profit that he might make if the house were either let to other tenants or was reconstructed and let out, but rather from the point of view of the tenants who have no alternative accommodation and who would be stranded in the open if an order for eviction were passed. the act itself contemplates eviction in cases where on the ground of the house being unfit for human habitation it has to be demolished either singly under section 7 or as one of a block of buildings under ch. so long therefore as a building can, without great detriment to health or safety, permit accommodation, the policy of the enactment would seem to suggest that the slum dweller should not be evicted unless alternative accommodation could be obtained for him. in this connection the learned attorney general brought to our attention the provisions of the delhi development act, 1957 (lxi of 1957) which makes provision for the design of a master plan for the city which, if executed, is likely to greatly reduce, if not to eliminate, slums altogether. it was suggested that taken in conjunction with this enactment it would be seen that the power to restrain eviction under section 19 of the 144 act is one which would not last for ever but to a limited period, though this could not naturally be defined by reference to fixed dates. we see force in this submission as well. in view of the foregoing we consider that there is enough guidance to the competent authority in the use of his discretion under section 19(1) of the act and we, therefore, reject the contention that section 19 is obnoxious to the equal protection of laws guaranteed by article 14 of the constitution. we need only add that it was not, and could not be, disputed that the guidance which we have hold could be derived from the enactment, and that it bears a reasonable and rational relationship to the object to be attained by the act and, in fact, would fulfil the purpose which the law seeks to achieve, viz., the orderly elimination of slums, with interim protection for the slum dwellers until they were moved into better dwellings. we are further of the opinion that the order of the competent authority in the present case is not open to challenge either, because it would be seen that the grounds upon which he has rejected the petitioner 's application for execution is in line with what we have stated to be the policy and purpose of the act. before leaving this topic it is necessary to consider a submission of learned counsel for the petitioner which is of immediate relevance to point under examination. he said that, no doubt, the decisions of this court had pointed out that it was not reasonable to expect the legislature to lay down expressly precise criteria for the guidance of the authorities who have to administer the law because of the difficulty, if not impossibility, of contemplating every single circumstance and prescribing rules so as to apply to such varying situations, and that was the raison d 'etre of vesting a large discretion in the hands of the administering authorities after indicating the general principles that ought to guide them. he however urged that in the present case there was no such insuperable difficulty, because the restriction provided for by section 19 of the act was superimposed on those which were 145 enacted by section 13 of the rent control act, and parliament when enacting the act, could easily have indicated with reference to the several grounds on which eviction could be had under the rent control act, the additional restrictions, or further conditions which would be taken into account by \"the competent authority\". if learned counsel meant by this submission that it was a possible mode of legislation, there is nothing to be said against it, but if he desired us to infer therefrom that because of the failure to adopt that mode, the power conferred by section 19 of the slum act contravened the guarantee under article 14, we cannot agree. in regard to this matter we desire to make two observations. in the context of modern conditions and the variety and complexity of the situations which present themselves for solution, it is not possible for the legislature to envisage in detail every possibility and make provision for them. the legislature therefore is forced to leave the authorities created by it an ample discretion limited, however, by the guidance afforded by the act. this is the ratio of delegated legislation, and is a process which has come to stay, and which one may be permitted to observe is not without its advantages. so long therefore as the legislature indicates, in the operative provisions of the statute with certainty, the policy and purpose of the enactment, the mere fact that the legislation is skeletal, or the fact that a discretion is left to those entrusted with administering the law, affords no basis either for the contention that there has been an excessive delegation of legislative power as to amount to an abdication of its functions, or that the discretion vested is uncanalised and unguided as to amount to a carte blanche to discriminate. the second is that if the power or discretion has been conferred in a manner which is legal and constitutional, the fact that parliament could possibly have made more detailed provisions, could obviously not be a ground for invalidating the law.", "completion": "in view of the foregoing we consider that there is enough guidance to the competent authority in the use of his discretion under section 19(1) of the act and

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: the next point argued by learned counsel for the 19 146 petitioner was that the power conferred on the competent authority by section 19(3) of the act was an excessive delegation of legislative power. as we have pointed out earlier, this submission is really another form, or rather another aspect of the objection based on the grant of an unfettered discretion or power which we have just now dealt with. it is needless to repeat, that so long as the legislature indicates its purpose and lays down the policy it is not necessary that every detail of the application of the law to particular cases should be laid down in the enactment itself. the reasons assigned for repelling the attack based on article 14 would suffice to reject this ground of objection as well. the last major objection urged by learned counsel was that the power vested in the competent authority \"at its sweet will and pleasure\" to refuse permission to execute a decree for eviction violated the right to hold property under article 19(1)(f) of the constitution and that the same was not saved by article 19(5) of the constitution for the reason that the restriction imposed on the exercise of the right was not reasonable. if counsel were right in his submission that the petitioner 's right to obtain possession of his building rested on the \"sweet will and pleasure of the competent authority\" there could be some substance in the argument. but as we had already had occasion to point out, it is not at the \"sweet will and pleasure\" of the competent authority that permission to evict could be granted or refused, but on principles gather able from the enactment, as explained earlier. learned counsel further urged that the right to hold property under article 19( 1)(f) included the right in the owner of a building to evict a tenant and enter into actual or physical occupation of the property. counsel is, no doubt, right in this submission but the 'freedom ' to 'hold property ' is not absolute but that, as he himself admitted, is subject, under article 19(5), to treasonable restrictions\" being placed upon it \"in the interests of the general public\". it was not suggested that slum dwellers would not constitute \"the general public\" and that if a legislation was designed to grant 147 them protection, it could not be justified as one in the interests of the \"general public\", because obviously the interests of such a vast number of the population in the country, their health, well being and morals, would, apart even from themselves, necessarily impinge upon and influence, for good or evil, the health, safety, well being and morality of the rest of the community as well. the only question that is capable of argument is whether the restriction is reasonable. a considerable part of learned counsel 's argument on the reasonableness of the restriction was devoted to showing that the vesting of an unfettered or unguided power in the competent authority to permit or not to permit eviction rendered the restriction unreasonable. this, as would be seen, is really a different form of presenting the case of the objection under article 14, and what we have said in dealing with the first point of the learned counsel would answer this portion of the objection. there are, however, a few more matters which have relevance about the objection on the score of the restriction not being reasonable within article 19(5) and the tests to be applied to determining its reasonableness to which we should refer. it has already been pointed out that the restrictions imposed on the right of the landlord to evict have a reasonable and rational connection with the object sought to be achieved by the act, viz., the ultimate elimination of slums with protection to the slum dwellers from being meanwhile thrown out on the streets. the question might still remain whether this restriction on the rights of the landlords is excessive in the sense that it invades and trenches on their rights in a manner or to an extent not really or strictly necessary to afford protection to the reasonable needs of the slum dwellers which it is the aim and object of the legislation to subserve. the criteria for determining the degree of restriction on the right to hold property which would be considered reasonable, are by no means fixed or static, but must obviously vary from age to age and be related to the adjustments necessary to solve the problems which communities face from time to time. the tests, therefore, evolved by communities living in sheltered or 148 placid times, or laid down in decisions applicable to them can hardly serve as a guide for the solution of the problems of post partition india with its stresses and strains arising out of movements of populations which have had few parallels in history. if law failed to take account of unusual situations of pressing urgency arising in the country, and of the social urges generated by the patterns of thought evolution and of social consciousness which we witness in the second half of this century, it would have to be written down as having failed in the very purpose of its existence. where the legislature fulfils its purpose and enacts laws, which in its wisdom, is considered necessary for the solution of what after all is a very human problem the tests of \"reasonableness\" have to be viewed in the context of the issues which faced the legislature.", "completion": "the last major objection

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: in the construction of such laws and particularly in judging of their validity the courts have necessarily to approach it from the point of view of furthering the social interest which it is the purpose of the legislation to promote, for the courts are not, in these matters, functioning as it were in vacuo, but as parts of a society which is trying, by, enacted law, to solve its problems and achieve social concord and peaceful adjustment and thus furthering the moral and material progress of the community as a whole. judged in the light of the above, we consider that the restrictions imposed cannot be said to be unreasonable. as we have already pointed out, the ban imposed on evictions is temporary, though learned counsel is right in saying that its duration is not definite. in the very nature of things the period when slums would have ceased to exist or restrictions placed upon owners of property could be completely lifted must, obviously, be indefinite and therefore the indefiniteness cannot be a ground for invalidity a ground upon which the restriction could be held to be unreasonable. again, there is an appeal provided from the orders of the competent authority to the chief administrator. if learned counsel is right in his submission that the power of the \"competent authority\" is unguided and that he had an unfettered 149 and arbitrary authority to exercise his discretion \"at his sweet will and pleasure\" the existence of a provision for appeals might not impart validity to such legislation. the reason for this is that the appellate power would be subject to the same vice as the power of the original authority and the imposition of one \" sweet will and pleasure\" over another of a lower authority, would not prevent discrimination or render the restriction reasonable. but if, as we have held earlier, the act by its preamble and by its provisions does afford a guidance to the \"competent authority\" by pointing out the manner in which the discretion vested in him should be exercised, the provision as to an appeal assumes a different significance. in such cases, if the \"competent authority\" oversteps the limits of his powers or ignores the policy behind the act and acts contrary to its declared intention, the appellate authority could be invoked to step in and correct the error. it would, therefore, be a provision for doubly safeguarding that the policy of the act is carried out and not ignored in each and every case that comes up before \"the competent authority\". the procedure laid down by the act for the hearing by the \"competent authority\" and the provisions for enquiry, renders the \"competent authority\" a quasi judicial functionary bound to follow fixed rules of procedure and its orders passed after such an enquiry are to be subject to appeals to the administrator. we consider these safeguards very relevant for_judging about the reasonableness of the restriction. in considering these matters one has to take into account the fact a fact of which judicial notice has to be taken that there has been an unprecedented influx of population into the capital, and in such a short interval, that there has not been time for natural processes of expansion of the city to adjust itself to the increased needs. remedies which in normal times might be considered an unreasonable restriction on the right to hold property would not bear that aspect or be so considered when viewed in a situation of emergency brought about by exceptional and unprecedented circumstances. just as pulling down a building to prevent the 150 spread of flames would be reasonable in the event of a fire, the reasonableness of the restrictions imposed by the impugned legislation has to be judged in the light of actual facts and not on a priori reasoning based on the dicta in decisions rendered in situations bearing not even the remotest resemblance to that which presented itself to parliament when the legislation now impugned was enacted. before concluding it is necessary to advert to a few points which were also urged by learned counsel for the petitioner. first it was said that the impugned section 19 of the act imposed a double restriction, a restriction super imposed on a restriction already existing by virtue of the provisions of the rent control act, and that this rendered it unreasonable. if by this submission learned counsel meant that different results as to constitutional validity flowed from whether the impugned section was part of the provisions of the rent control act, or was a section in an independent enactment, the argument is clearly untenable. if, however, that was not meant, but that in the context of the restrictions already imposed by the rent control act section 19 of the act was really unnecessary and therefore. an unreasonable restraint on the freedom of the landlord, what we have said earlier ought to suffice to repel the argument. learned counsel next drew our attention to section 38 of the rent control act which reads: \"the provisions of this act and of the rules made thereunder shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any such law.", "completion": "if learned counsel is right in his submission that the power of the \"competent authority\" is unguided and that he had an unfettered 149 and arbitrary authority to exercise his discretion \"at his sweet will and pleasure\" the existence of a provision for appeals might not impart validity to such legislation.\nbut if, as we have held earlier, the act by its preamble and by its provisions does afford a guidance to the \"competent authority\" by pointing out the manner in which the discretion vested in him should be exercised, the provision as to an appeal assumes a different significance.\nfirst it was said that the impugned section 19 of the act imposed a double restriction, a restriction super imposed on a restriction already existing by virtue of the provisions of the rent control act, and that this rendered it unreasonable.\nif by this submission learned counsel meant that different results as to constitutional validity flowed from

varma, for the respondent no. 1. 1961. april 24. the judgment of the court was delivered by ayyangar, j. this appeal comes before us on a certificate granted by high court of patna under article 133(1) of the constitution. the appellant had filed a suit against the state of bihar before the subordinate judge, daltonganj and had succeeded in obtaining a decree in his favour the details of which we shall presently narrate. the state preferred an appeal to the high court and by the judgment now under appeal the learned judges of the high court had allowed the appeal and dismissed the suit with costs, and the plaintiff has come upon appeal to this court. the facts giving rise to the suit and the appeal may now be briefly stated. the village of jun in the district of palamau in the state of bihar was within the estate of the raja of ranka. this proprietor had granted a mokarari lease of the village which consisted mostly of forest lands, in favour of certain persons who have been referred to in these proceedings as the manjhis. the manjhis in their turn entered into a registered agreement on february 23, 1946, with gurudutt sharma the appellant before us, whereby the latter was, in consideration of the payment of a sum of rs. 6,000, granted the right to cut and remove bamboos and certain other timber to be found in a specified area of this forest village. this right the appellant was to have for a period of 8 years ending on march 1, 1954. by a further deed executed on march 15, 1946, which was however unregistered, the manjhis granted to the appellant the right to pluck, or collect and carry away bidi leaves in the same forest area for 295 a period of 9 years ending march 1, 1955, for a con sideration of rs. 200. it is the case of the appellant that immediately after these deeds were executed, he started cutting the trees and otherwise exercising the rights granted to him under them. meanwhile the governor of bihar who had, by proclamation issued by him under section 93 of the government of india act, 1935, assumed to himself the powers vested in the provincial legislature, enacted in exercise of the powers so assumed, the bihar private forests act, 1946 (bihar 3 of 1946). it is the validity of this enactment and the interpretation of its provisions and. of the similar provisions in the bihar private forests act, 1947 (bihar 9 of 1948), by which it was repealed and reenacted, that form the main subject of controversy in this appeal. it is therefore necessary to set out certain of the relevant provisions and also the action taken under them in order to appreciate the contentions raised by learned counsel for the appellant. the governor 's act of 1946 extended to the whole of the province of bihar and came into force on february 25, 1946, when having received the assent of the governor general it was first published in the bihar gazette. there were certain forests which were excepted from the operation of this act by its second section, but the forests in the village of jun with which this appeal is concerned were not among them. the act contained the definition of a \"landlord\" as meaning 'the owner of the estate or tenure in which a forest is comprised who is entitled to exercise any rights in the forests '. it is obvious that the manjhis would be \"landlords\" within this definition. section 4 of this act enacted: \"the rights of the landlord and. the rights of any other person to cut, collect or remove trees, timber or other forest produce in or from. in any forest shall not be exercised in contravention of the provisions made in or under this act. \" there were other restrictions oil the rights of landlords or persons claiming through them but these are not very material for the point required to be decided in this appeal. chapter iii of this enactment which 296 comprised sections 13 to 30 dealt with \"private protected forests\" which were defined in section 3(10) as 'a forest specified in a notification issued under sub section (1) of section 29 '. section 13 with which this chapter opens made provision for the provincial government, \"if satisfied that it was necessary in the public interest to apply the provisions of this chapter to any private forest\" to constitute such forest \"a private protected forest.", "completion": "' the expression 'acquisition ' in our

(a), (b) and (c), there is no requirement in terms, that the name of the landlord should be set out. it will further be observed that the notification enables any person claiming 303 interest as a landlord and who considers that his interests are likely to be affected by the proceedings taken to prefer his objections to the declaration as a \"private protected forest\". in other words, the notification is a general notice and its aim is to specify the land in respect of which the declaration is proposed to be made, so that the emphasis is more upon the identity of the land than about the person who owns the land or has rights over it. besides, the section in terms specifies what the legal and essential requirements as regards the contents of the notification are and the ordinary rule of construction would point to those requirements being exhaustive of what the law demands. if therefore the specification or mention of the name of the landlord is not an express requirement of the section, is such a specification or mention a requirement by any necessary intendment? we have already set out the text of the impugned notification dated october 14, 1946, and it would be seen that it did mention the name of the landlord, but this was incorrect in the sense that the raja of ranka who was the proprietor of the estate but who had parted with his rights over the forests by a mokrari lease in favour of the manjhis was shown as the landlord instead of the manjhis. it was never the case of the appellant that the mention of the proprietor 's name in the notification misled him or anyone as regards the identity of the land. we might also mention that mr. jha, learned counsel for the appellant admitted that he could not impugn the validity of the notification if notwithstanding that the name of the landlord specified was incorrect, the notification was served upon the proper landlord, it is also common ground that the appellants took part in the proceedings under ch. iii, so that he knew the identity of the property which was intended to be dealt with by the notification.", "completion": "we consider that it will be convenient to deal first with the point as to whether, assuming that the bihar private forests act, 1946 and 1948 were valid, the proceedings under chapter iii of the act for declaring the village of jun as \"a private protected forest\" were legal before considering the question as to the constitutionality of the act raised by the additional grounds urged before us.\nwhenever it is proposed by the provincial government to constitute any private forest a private protected forest, the provincial government shall issue a notification (a copy of which shall be served on the landlord in the prescribed manner)(a) declaring that it is proposed to constitute such forest a private protected forest; (b) specifying as nearly as possible, the situation and limits of such forest; and (c) stating that any landlord whose interests are likely to be affected if such forest is constituted a private protected forest may, within such period, not being less than three months from the date of the notification, as shall be stated in the notification, present to the collector in writing any objection to such forest being constituted a private protected forest.\nit will further be observed that the notification enables any person claiming 303 interest as a landlord and who considers that his interests are likely to be affected by the proceedings taken to prefer his objections to the declaration as a \"private protected forest\".\nwe have already set out the text of the impugned notification dated october 14, 1946, and it would be seen that it did mention the name of the landlord, but this was incorrect in the sense that the raja of ranka who was the proprietor of the estate but who had parted with his rights over the forests by a mokrari lease in favour of the manjhis was shown as the landlord instead of the manjhis."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: the succeeding provisions of the enactment far from supporting the case that the correct specification of the name of the landlord is a legal pre requisite of a valid notification, points to the conclusion that so far 304 as the notification is concerned the name of the landlord is not a legal requirement. for instance, reference may be made to section 21 where provision is made for the issue of an order prohibiting, until the date of the publication of a notification under section 29, the cutting, collecting or removal of any trees in any forest. such an order might be issued simultaneously with a notification under section 14 and the order is \"to be published in the neighbourhood of the forest\". provisions of this sort indicate what we have already mentioned, that the emphasis in the notification is on specification of the land and not so much on who the owner or the person interested in it was. we are therefore clearly of the opinion that the learned judges of the high court were right in holding that the notification under section 14 did not contravene the statute. the next question that arises is whether the notification which was legal under section 14, had been properly served on the interested persons as required by the provisions of ch. the principal point that was urged to call in question the validity of the service of the notifications was based on the fact that the notices had to be served under the terms of section 14 \"in the prescribed manner\" and that the rules which prescribed the manner of service were framed and issued only on october 21, 1946, with the result that any service of notice effected before that date could not be deemed to be a proper service or a service in accordance with the rules and therefore of the statute. we might however state that it was admitted that no notices were, in fact, served. any enquiry, however, of the validity of the service of notices required by section 14 or other provisions of the act or the effect of the failure to serve them has been rendered superfluous by the provisions of section 2 of the bihar private forests (validating) act (act xii of 1949) which enacted: \"no proceeding or action taken under section 15, 21 and 29 of the bihar private forests act, 1946 or under section 15, 21 or 30 of the bihar private forests act, 1948, or under any other section of any of the said acts from the respective dates of commencement of the said acts, to the date of 305 commencement of this act shall be deemed to be invalid or shall be called in question in any court, or proceeding whatsoever merely on the ground that a copy of the notification under section 14 of any of the said acts was not served on the landlord, or that there was any defect or irregularity in the service of such notification, nor shall any suit, prosecution or other legal proceeding whatsoever, lie in any court of law against any servant of the crown for or on account of or in respect of any such proceeding or action taken by him.\" the learned subordinate judge, by a process of reasoning which we are unable to follow, held that the terms of this enactment were insufficient to validate the non service of the notice on the landlord as required by section 14 and the other provisions of ch. iii of the bihar private forests act. the learned judges of the high court, on the other hand, held and, in our opinion, correctly, that the effect of the failure to serve notices or any informality in the service of the notices required by section 14 and succeeding sections of the act was rectified and validated by the act. in agreement with the learned judges of the high court we hold that the proceedings taken under ch. iii of the act, including the notification issued under section 14 were valid and in accordance with the law and that if the bihar private forests act were valid the plaintiff could have no legal ground of complaint which he could agitate in the suit and that the suit was therfore properly directed to be dismissed. this leaves the question of the constitutional validity of the act for consideration. it is necessary to state at the outset, that under the deeds dated february 23, 1946 and march 15, 1946, the status of the appellant quod the manjhis is only that of a licensee or contractor having the right to cut and remove the trees etc. and not that of a lessee. this was the conclusion reached by the subordinate judge on the relevant terms of the two deeds and this was apparently not even challenged in the high court. on this basis the only provisions of the act which could be said to directly invade the rights of the appellant are those 306 contained in ch. iii the material sections of which we have already set out. as provision is made in section 22 of the act for the ascertainment and payment of compensation to forest contractors whose rights were either modified or extinguished, the plea that there was a violation of the guarantee against acquisition by the state without compensation contained in section 299(2) of the government of india ' act, 1935, would be seen to have no factual foundation. but learned counsel for the appellant urged that the extinction of the rights of contractors under the provisions of ch.", "completion": "the next question that arises is whether the notification which was legal under section 14, had been properly served on the interested persons as required by the provisions of ch.\nany enquiry, however, of the validity

forests primarily dealt with forests which were the property of the government or in which government had proprietary rights. but it had also a chapter ch. vi dealing with \"control on forests or land not being the property of the government\". section 35 of the act enabled the local government by a notification in the local official gazette to regulate the maintenance of forests for particular purposes and pass orders in that behalf, and section 36 enacted that \"in case of neglect of, or wilful disobedience to, such regulations\", and what is more important, \"if the purposes of any work

not so much concerned with the grounds upon which the government could take over and manage forests belonging to 313 private proprietors, as with the practice of the government taking over the management of the forests if public interests so require. this interest might vary from time to time but the above legislation would show that if public interest did require, the act authorized government to take over the management of private forests on terms of making over the income received to the proprietor. it is unnecessary to dilate upon the role of forests in a country whose economy is predominantly agricultural and it has been this aspect that has prompted the legislation to which we have just now adverted. apart from being an important source of fuel and of raw materials necessary for domestic, industrial and agricultural purposes, their preservation is essential for the development of cattle wealth by providing grazing grounds. their function in the conservation of soil fertility and in the maintenance of waterregime by improving the filth and the water holding capacity of the soil cannot be exaggerated. they protect the land against excessive soil erosion caused either by rainfall or against a desiccation and erosion by winds. their beneficial influence on the growth of crops and on the maintenance of an equitable climate cannot be over stressed (vide first five year plan, p. 285). thanks to the inroads made on forestwealth owing to the necessities created by the war, we had the spectacle of large forest areas denuded of their timber, afforestation making either a slow progress or not attempted at all. so long as the war continued the sacrifice of the forests was one of the incidents which the country had to bear as part of the war effort but owing to the high prices of fuel and timber, the practice of denudation of forests, which started during the wartime, continued and landholders owning private forests sought to make quick gains by leasing out their forests for large scale cutting. in these circumstances public interest and national economy required that this process should be stopped and the ravages caused by wartime destruction should be made good by scientific management and regulation of forests and by a process of afforestation.", "completion": "\" would cover legislation on forests, because of the special

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: it was 314 in these circumstances that in several provinces of india during the year 1946 when these provinces were under the rule of governors under section 93 of the government of india act, 1935, enactments were passed vesting in government power to take over and manage for the purposes abovementioned areas of forest lands belonging to private persons. the situation, therefore, demanded that there should be a large extension of the grounds upon which such private forests would be taken over for better management by the state officials as compared with ch. v of the indian forests act, 1927. the correlation between bihar act iii of 1946 now impugned and the indian forests act, 1927, is brought out in the long title of ,the former, the operative words of which are repeated in the preamble: \"an act to provide for the conservation of forests which are not vested in the crown or in respect of which notifications and orders issued under the indian forests act, 1927 are not in force. \" the impugned act was therefore an act supplementary to, or rather a complement of the indian forests act of 1927 and is clearly covered by the entry 'forests ' in item 22 of state legislative list. the argument, therefore, that entry 22 enabled a legislation to be passed in relation to \"forests\" but did not include therein the power to assume management and control of forests belonging to private proprietors is entirely without foundation. in view of what we have just now stated it would follow that the argument concerning the legislative competence to enact the bihar acts of 1946 and 1948 must be rejected. the next submission to be considered is whether the impugned enactments violate section 299(2) of the government of india act, 1935. section 299(2) runs in these terms: \"299(2). neither the federal nor a provincial legislature shall have power to make any law authorising the compulsory acquisition for public purposes of any land, or any commercial or industrial undertaking, or any interest in, or in any company owning, any commercial or industrial undertaking, 315 unless the law provides for the payment of compensation for the property acquired and either fixes the amount of compensation, or specifies the principles on which, and the manner in which, it is to be determined. \" the main, if not the entire argument of learned counsel for the appellant on this point was vested on certain passages found in the decision of this court in dwarkadas shrinivas of bombay vs the sholapur spinning & weaving co. ltd. (1). the validity of the law that was there considered was a post constitution enactment (act xxviii of 1950 dated april 10, 1950) which replaced an ordinance issued in january, 1950. the rights of the appellant before this court had to be considered in the light of the guarantees contained in part iii of the constitution. under the provisions of the enactment there impugned the management of the sholapur spinning & weaving co. ltd., was taken over by the government and the question that was debated was whether this taking over amounted to \"an acquisition\" such as is referred to in article 31(2) of the constitution in these terms: \"31(2). no property shall be compulsorily acquired or requisitioned save for a public purpose and save by authority of a law which provides for compensation for the property so acquired or requisitioned and either fixes the amount of the compensation or specifies the principles on which, and the manner in which, the compensation is to be determined and given; and no such law shall be called in question in any court on the ground that the compensation provided by that law is not ade quate. \" mahajan, j.

articles 132 and 133(1) of the constitution, and raises for consideration the constitutionality of section 13 of the madras buildings (lease & rent control) act, 1949; and the legality of an order of the state government passed thereunder. the facts giving rise to the appeal are briefly as follows: the dispute relates to promises no. 1, blackers road, mount road, madras a property which was originally owned by one sir haji ismail sait. in or about the year 1914 one venkayya obtained a lease of this property from sir haji ismail sait and constructed a cinema theatre thereon 172 which he ran under the name of \"the gaiety theatre\". venkayya was adjudicated an insolvent and the official assignee of madras in whom his estate, including the leasehold interest in the suit site vested, obtained a further lease of the property from the representatives of sir haji ismail sait who had by then died, for a period of 9 years from march 1926. thereafter the official assignee sold the super structure of the theatre to one mrs. madan to whom he also assigned the unexpired portion of the lease. mrs. madan, subsequently, obtained a further lease of the property from the representatives of sir haji ismail sait 's estate for a further period of 7 years from june 1935. mrs. madan was thus the owner of the superstructure and the lessee of the site, with a term which would expire in or about may 1942. while one t. section pl. p. chidambaram chetty who is the second respondent before us obtained a conveyance of all the rights which mrs. madan possessed in the super structure and in the lease for a sum of rs. 36,000 under a registered deed dated january 4, 1937, and he ran the cinema house from then. there was litigation between the heirs of sir haji ismail sait, pending on the original side of high court of madras, and by interim orders passed in two suits (c. section nos. 280 and 286 of 1939), the high court appointed two advocates as joint receivers to administer ' the property in suit. in the early months of 1940, one j. h. irani, the father of p. j. irani the appellant before us had negotiated with the recei vers for a lease of a property adjacent to no. 1 blackers road with a view to construct a cinema theatre whereon. that lease was for a period of 21 years and would have expired in or about april may 1961. irani offered to the receivers to take a lease also of the property now in dispute and on which the gaiety theatre stood, also till april may 1961. the receivers then moved the court for directions regarding the grant of the lease. the second respondent, whose term of lease would have expired in 1942, was offered by the court the option of taking a lease for 21 years from the 1st of may 1940 but he expressed his 173 unwillingness to take a lease for such a long term. he was, however, willing to have the lease continued for a period of 7 years from the 1st of may 1940, i.e., for 5 years beyond the term of his then existing lease. the court thereupon passed an order on may 2, 1940 reading: \"the lessee of the gaiety theatre (chidambaram chetty) will be given a lease of seven years from this date. they will not be given any further option. on the expiry of that period, i.e., from 2nd may 1947 the same may be included in the lease of j. h. irani at the same rate of rent at which it is being leased to the lessee of the gaiety theatres. \" in accordance with this order the receivers of the estate of the late sir haji ismail sait executed two lease deeds (1) in favour of the second respondent for a period of 7 years from may 1, 1940 and (2) a reversionary lease in favour of j. h. irani for a period of 13 years 11 1/2 months commencing from may 1, 1947, i.e., on the expiry of the lease in favour of the second respondent, this term being fixed so as to be coterminous with the lease of the neighbouring property which irani was being granted. the term of the lease in favour of the second respondent would, therefore, have ended on may 1, 1947 but before that date madras buildings (lease & rent control) act 1946 (madras xv of 1946) came into force under which tenants in possession who continued in occupation of residential or non residential buildings could not be evicted therefrom except by proceedings taken under the act before designated officers and on stated grounds which did not include

in dispute and that notwithstanding the termination of the term he was statutorily entitled to continue in possession even after the expiry of the lease on may 1, 1947. this is the result of decisions rendered in certain proceedings between the parties to which we shall immediately refer. irani, the, reversionary lessee called upon the second respondent to surrender possession in 174 accordance with the conditions of his lease, but the latter declined to do so relying upon the act and the protection which it conferred upon him. thereupon the 'present appellant p. j. irani as representing the estate of his father who had by then died, filed a suit on the original side of the madras high court (c. section 479 of 1947) for evicting the second respondent from the property. it may be mentioned that the suit was based upon the allegation that what had been leased to venkayya originally was a vacant site without any buildings and that consequently madras act xv of 1946 which did not apply to leases of mere vacant sites did not apply to protect the second respondent 's possession. the suit was, however, dismissed by judgment rendered on april 22, 1948, on the finding that a building as well as the site had been included in the lease, which brought it within the scope and protection of the act. the appellant filed an appeal against this judgment (original side appeal 37 of 1948) which was also dismissed on july 29,1951, on the same finding. even while the appeal was still pending before the high court, irani applied to the government of madras for exemption of the premises from the operation of the act. by the date of this application madras act xv of 1946 had been repealed and its provisions substantially re enacted in the madras buildings (lease & rent control) act, 1949, but as the provisions of the two enactments on the points which arise for decision in this appeal are identical it is sufficient if reference is made to those of the later act. a provision for exemption being granted from the operation of the act by the state govern ment was contained in section 13 of the act (madras buildings) lease & rent control act., 1949), to which we shall hereafter refer as the act, in the following terms: \"notwithstanding anything contained in this act the state government may by a notification in the fort st. george gazette exempt any building or class of buildings from all or any of the provisions of this act. \" the government, however, by their order dated june. 175 4, 1951, rejected this application for exemption on the ground that the matter was then sub judice. after the dismissal of the appeal by the division bench the appellant irani moved the government afresh by a further petition filed in or about december, 1951, praying for the same relief. the government, by their order dated june 4, 1952, granted the exemption sought and the relevant notification which appeared in the fort st. george gazette ran: \"in exercise of the powers conferred by section 13 of the madras buildings (lease & rent control) act 1949 (madras act xxv of 1949) his excellency the governor of madras hereby exempts the building no. 1 blackers road, mount road, madras (gaiety theatre) from all the provisions of the said act.\" and it was authenticated by the chief secretary to government. the second respondent thereupon made a petition to the high court under article 226 of the constitution challenging the legality and propriety of this order of exemption on the principal ground that the provision contained in section 13 of the act enabling the government to exempt particular buildings from the operation of the act, vested in them an unguided and arbitrary discretion which was unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by article 14 of the constitution. in the affidavit in support of the petition, the second respondent further averred that in the order impugned \"no justification has been shown for depriving the petitioner of the beneficial provisions of the rent control act\". both the state of madras whose order was impugned as well as the appellant irani for whose benefit the order was passed were made respondents to this writ petition. the writ petition was dismissed by a learned single judge of the high court by order dated march 12, 1953, on the ground that the constitutional validity of section 13 of the act had already been upheld by a division bench of the court in another case. the second respondent thereafter took the matter in appeal under cl. 15 of the letters patent. at the time this appeal was heard the bench had before it, two other appeals in which also the question whether section 13 of the 176 act violated article 14 of the constitution had been raised. the three appeals were heard together and this common point was first decided by a judgment pronounced on october 23, 1953. the learned judges held that section 13 of the act did not offend article 14 of the constitution but that individual orders granting the exemption might be examined to find out whether such orders were within the policy and purpose of the act or whether they were discriminatory and therefore offended article 14.", "completion": "it may be mentioned that the suit was based upon the allegation that what had been leased to venkayya originally was a vacant site without any buildings

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: in this view the grounds upon which exemption was granted in each of the three cases before them were separately considered and in the appeal by the second respondent the learned judges, after examining the reasons disclosed by the government as to why they granted exemption in the particular case, held that those reasons were not germane to the purpose for which the,power of exemption had been vested in them and quashed the order of exemption. irani feeling aggrieved by the decision of the high court applied to and obtained a certificate under articles 132 and 133(1) of the constitution and has filed the present appeal before us. the state of madras has not appealed but as a respondent has filed a statement which was repeated by counsel on their behalf, that they were not interested in disputing the correctness of the judgment of the high court but left the matter to be decided between the rival contestants, viz., irani and the second respondent. mr. sachin chowdhary, learned counsel for the appellant irani, urged substantially two points before us: (1) that the impugned order of the government exempting the buildings under section 13 of the act was executive or administrative in its nature and not quasi judicial as wrongly held by the high court, and was, therefore, not amenable to be quashed by the issue of a writ of certiorari, (2) assuming that the order was quasi judicial, still it could be quashed or set aside only if it were mala fide or proceeded upon grounds wholly extraneous for the purpose of the enactment and that in the instant case neither of these conditions was fulfilled and the high court was 177 therefore not justified in setting it aside. he further submitted that the high court had erroneously converted itself, as it were, into a court of appeal, put itself in the place of the government and decided the case on the basis of what the court itself would have done if it were the exempting authority. learned counsel urged that this went beyond the supervisory jurisdiction of the high court in the exercise of its powers under article 226 even when dealing with a quasi judicial order. before dealing with these points it is necessary to mention that obviously these arguments proceed upon the basis that the power conferred by section 13 of the act on the state government to exempt \"buildings or class of buildings from the operation of the act is constitutionally valid. we are saying this because mr. viswanatha sastri learned counsel for the second respondent disputed before us the correctness of the decision of the high court dated october 23, 1953, upholding the validity of section 13 of the act. it is manifest therefore that the point urged by mr. viswanatha sastri should first be decided before considering the points urged in support of the appeal. learned counsel for the appellant, however, raised an objection, to counsel for the respondent being permitted to contest the validity of section 13 of the act. he pointed out that the question of the validity of section 13 had been decided by a judgment rendered on october 23, 1953, and that as the respondent did not prefer an appeal to this court from that judgment, he was precluded from agitating this question in the appeal now before us. we consider this objection as without substance. by its order dated october 23, 1953 writ appeal 28 of 1953 against the decision in which this appeal has been brought was not disposed of but was still kept pending before the high court for further consideration and as observed by the learned chief justice in that judgment: \"in this view we cannot strike down section 13 of the act as inconsistent with the constitution and void but we shall have to examine each case on its merits\". 23 178 writ appeal 28 of 1953 was thereafter dealt with on its merits and it was this examination which resulted in its being allowed. in our opinion, therefore, the two judgments have to be read together and as really part of one proceeding, though for convenience and with a view to define the scope of the arguments the court expressed its opinion on the constitutional point at an earlier stage. we also consider that it is doubtful if an appeal would have lain from the judgment of the high court dated october 23, 1953, and even assuming that it did in view of the matters which we have set out earlier, the respondent cannot be precluded from contesting the correctness of the conclusion of the high court, by reason of his not having moved this court under article 136 of the constitution. we therefore consider that the respondent is entitled to support the judgment in his favour by attacking those portions of that judgment which are against him. the submission of mr. viswanatha sastri was that section 13 of the act conferred an unguided and arbitrary power on government to discriminate between one building and another and choose at their will and pleasure particular buildings which would be subject to the provisions of the act and others which would not be so subject, the tenants in the latter being deprived of the protection conferred on other tenants similarly situated.", "completion": "sachin chowdhary, learned counsel for the appellant irani, urged substantially two points before us: (1) that the impugned order of the government exempting the buildings under section 13 of the act was executive or administrative in its nature and not quasi judicial as wrongly held by the high

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: he further urged that whether or not a power to exempt a class of buildings was valid, because in such a case there might possibly be an element of classification based on rational grounds grounds germane to carry out the policy or purpose of the act the same could not be predicated of the power to grant exemption for individual buildings because in the latter case it would be merely an arbitrary exercise of power discriminating between one building and another, or one tenant and another and which would, therefore, render the very conferment of the power invalid as in violation of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by article 14. the arguments addressed to us were the same as bad been urged before the learned judges of the high 179 court and had been repelled by them. they pointed out that it was not correct to say that the enactment did not sufficiently disclose the policy and purpose of the act which furnished adequate guidance for the basis of the exercise of the power of exemption. the preamble to the act ran: \"whereas it is expedient to regulate the letting of residential and non residential buildings and to control the rents of such buildings and to prevent unreasonable eviction of tenants therefrom in the state\". this meant that the legislation was enacted for achieving three purposes: (1) the regulation of letting, (2) the control of rents, and (3) the prevention of unreasonable eviction of tenants from residential and non residential buildings. the act was the latest in the series of enactments and orders dating back to the period of the second world war when due, inter alia, to large scale movement of populations to urban areas, there was an acute shortage of accommodation in the principal towns, as a result of which tenants ousted from buildings occupied by them on the termination of their tenancies could not find alternative accommodation and were thrown on the streets, and thus owners of house property could, if left unchecked, unfairly exploit those who sought accommodation. the enactment in terms protected the rights of tenants in occupation of buildings from being charged unreasonable rates of rent and from being unreasonably evicted therefrom. tenants who required this protection included, of course, those whose duration of tenancy under the ordinary law had expired and who would, therefore, have been liable to be ejected from the buildings occupied by them. accordingly, the definition of a \"tenant\" included those who continued in possession notwithstanding their term of tenancy had expired and even those against whom decrees for eviction had been passed by civil courts but under which eviction had not taken place. though the enactment thus conferred these rights on tenants, it was possible that the statutory protection could either have caused great hardship to a 180 landlord or was the subject of abuse by the tenant himself. it was not possible for the statute itself to contemplate every such contingency and make specific provision therefor in the enactment. it was for this reason that a power of exemption in general terms was conferred on the state government which, however, could be used not for the purpose of discriminating between tenant and tenant, but in order to further the policy and purpose of the act which was, in the context of the present case, to prevent unreasonable eviction of tenants. the learned judges of the high court, therefore, held that while section 13 of the act was constitutionally valid, any individual order of exemption passed by the government could be the subject of judicial review by the courts for finding out whether (a) it was discriminatory so as to offend article 14 of the constitution, (b) the order was made on grounds which were germane or relevant to the policy and purpose of the act, and (c) it was not otherwise malafide. we find ourselves in complete agreement with the approach and conclusion of the learned judges of the high court to the consideration of the question of the constitutional validity of section 13 of the act. the meaning and scope of article 14 of the constitution has been the subject of several decisions of this court, a number of which have been considered by us in some detail in jyoti pershad vs administrator of union territory (writ petition 67 etc. of 1959) in which we have pronounced judgment today. in view of this we find it unnecessary to traverse the same ground except to say that in the case before us enough guidance is afforded by the preamble and operative provisions of the act, for the exercise of the discretionary power vested in government so as to render the impugned section not open to attack as a denial of the equal protection of the laws. in our judgment, the provision now impugned belongs to the class numbered (v) in the analysis of the decision on article 14 by das c. j. in ram krishna dalmia vs justice tendolkar (1). (1) ; , 300. 181 \"a statute may not make a classification of the persons or things to whom their provisions are intended to apply and leave it to the discretion of the government to select or classify the persons or things for applying those provisions according to the policy or the principle laid down by the statute itself for guidance of the exercise of discretion by the government in the matter of such selection or classification. if the government in making the selection or classification does not proceed on or follow such policy or principle. . . .", "completion": "he further urged that whether or not a power to exempt a class of buildings was valid, because in such a case there might possibly be an element of classification based on rational grounds grounds germane to carry out the policy or purpose of the act the same could not be predicated of the power to grant exemption for individual buildings because in the latter case it would be merely an arbitrary exercise of power discriminating between one building and another, or one tenant and another and which would, therefore, render the very conferment of the power invalid as in violation of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by article 14.\nit was for this reason that a power of exemption in general terms was conferred on the state government which, however, could be used not for the purpose of discriminating between tenant and tenant, but in order to further the policy and purpose of the act which was, in the context of the present case, to prevent unreasonable eviction of tenants.\nthe learned judges of the high court, therefore, held that while section 13 of the act was constitutionally valid, any individual order of exemption passed by the government could be the subject of judicial review by the courts for finding out whether (a) it was discriminatory so as to offend article 14 of the constitution, (b) the order was made on grounds which were germane or relevant to the policy and purpose of the act, and (c) it was not otherwise malafide.\nin view of this we find it unnecessary to traverse the same ground except to say that in the case before us enough guidance is afforded by the preamble and operative provisions of the act, for the exercise of the discretionary power vested in government so as to render the impugned section not open to attack as a denial of the equal protection of the laws."}

(1) ; , 621. 182 we shall now proceed to consider the points. urged by learned counsel for the appellant contesting the correctness of the decision of the high court setting aside the order of government exempting the premises in dispute for the reason that it was passed on grounds not germane to the purpose for which the power was conferred. as already stated, the first point urged was that the order granting the exemption was an executive or an administrative order which was not amenable to being quashed by the issue of a writ of certiorari. we consider there is no substance in this objection. if the high court were right in their view that the order of exemption was passed for reasons which did not fall within the purpose for which the power was conferred by section 13 of the act the order itself would be one discriminatory of the second respondent as violating his fundamental right to equal protection of the laws. in such an event article 226 would certainly be available to set aside such an order which affected the fundamental right of the petitioner before the court. indeed, it was on the ground that individual orders passed by government by virtue of the power conferred upon it by section 13 of the act were examinable by the court for their violating article 14 that the constitutionality of section 13 was upheld and in the circumstances no objection could, therefore, be taken to a judicial review of such individual orders. besides, even if the order did not violate article 14, still if the high court were right in the view that the same was beyond the powers conferred on government by section 13 of the act, we see no substance in the contention that the court lacks power under article 226 to set aside an ultra vires order vitally affecting a person 's right to statutory protection against eviction. we do not consider that immunity from interference by the courts could be sought for order,% which are plainly ultra vires merely because they were passed bona fide in the sense of being without indirect motive. particularly so when the power of the high court under article 226 of the constitution is not limited to the issue of writs falling under particular groupings, such as the certiorari, mandamus, etc., as these writs 183 have been understood in england, but the power is general to issue any direction to the authorities, viz., for enforcement of fundamental rights as well as for other purposes. the second point urged was, and this was the main point argued by learned counsel for the appellant,that the learned judges of the high court were in error in holding (a) that the reasons given by the government were not germane to the purpose or policy of the act and, therefore, outside the power conferred on them by section 13 of the act, and (b) in con stituting themselves, as it were, as an appellate authority and examining the reasons which induced the government to grant the exemption, and pronouncing upon the correctness or otherwise of these reasons. before considering this argument it is necessary to advert to a submission of the learned counsel for the appellant suggesting that the high court were in error in calling for the reasons which induced the government to pass the orders of exemption, though when the reasons were before the court it was in a position to examine the legality of the order. we do not consider this submission well founded. the entire basis for upholding the constitutional validity of section 13 of the act and considering that it did not offend the equal protection of the law guaranteed by article 14 of the constitution was, that the discretion or the power conferred upon government was not unguided, uncanalised or arbitrary, but that it had to be exercised in accordance with the policy and object of the enactment gatherable from the preamble as well as its operative provisions.", "completion": "urged by learned counsel for the appellant

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: the order itself might on its face have shown that it conformed to this requirement, in which event it would have been for the party challenging the validity of the order to establish to the satisfaction of the court that it was malafide or had been passed on grounds not contemplated by or extraneous to, the object and purpose of the enactment or the principles which should have governed the exercise of the power. for instance, if the exemption had been in favour of a particular class of 184 buildings, say those belonging to charities religious or secular the classification would have been apparent in the very order of exemption. where, however, the exemption granted is not of any class of buildings which would ex facie disclose a classification, but the exemption is of a specified building owned by a or in which b is a tenant, then prima facie it would be discriminatory and when the legality of the order is challenged, its intra vires character could be sustained only by disclosing the reasons which led to the passing of the order. in the present case, when the matter was before the appellate court the advocate general filed a memorandum setting out the reasons why exemption was granted in the three cases before the court. in regard to the exemption which was the subject of controversy in writ appeal 28 of 1953 with which we are concerned, the memorandum which the government filed ran: \"the government exempted the building. . . . for the following reasons: (1)when the high court offered in 1940 to lease out the premises in question for a period of 21 years, sri chettiar elected to take it on lease only for a period of seven years, which expired in 1947. as per the high court 's order in c. section nos. 280 to 286 of 1939, sri j. h. irani, father of sri p. j. irani took a lease of the promises for a period of 13 years 11 1/2 months from 1947 and he deposited rs. 10,000 towards the said lease. he is therefore entitled for the benefits from 1948 onwards. (2)had not the rent control act come into force, sri p. j. irani would have got possession in the ordinary course as per high court 's order and the terms of the lease deed. the operation of the act is therefore really a hardship to him. (3)sri chettiar is only an absentee lessee and he is having several other business in south india. (4)the conduct of sri chidambaram chettiar in refusing to surrender the possession of the building to sri p. j. irani who had taken a valid lease under 185 the orders of the high court is that of a hard litigant seeking to exploit the letter of the law without much regard to bona fides; and (5)sri chettiar had already managed to be in possession of the building for five more years than he was legitimately entitled to be.\" the learned judges of the high court held that the reasons which led the government to grant the exemption were not those which were countenanced by the policy or purpose of the act and that the order of exemption was, therefore, invalid. in doing so the learned judges said: \"reasons 1, 2 and 4 go together and have refe rence to the order of the high court in 1940 directing the receivers to execute a lease for seven years to the appellant and after the expiry of that period to grant a lease for fourteen years to the second respondents father. it is undoubtedly true that but for the application of the act, the second res pondent 's father would have obtained possession of the premises after the expiry of lease in favour of the appellant. that could be said of thousands of cases in which the leases in favour of tenants have expired and, but for the act the owners would be entitled to obtain possession of the demised premises. if this circumstance alone is sufficient to exempt any premises from the operation of the act, then the act itself should be repealed. . . . . there is no policy or principle involved in this circumstance. \" we agree with the learned judges in the view here expressed. the mere fact that the tenant continued in possession after the termination of the tenancy is by itself no ground why he should be evicted from the premises, because it is the very policy of the act to protect the right of tenants to continue in possession of the premises after the termination of their term because of the great difficulty of their obtaining alternative accommodation. the circumstance, therefore, of the termination of the second respondent 's tenancy cannot afford a justification for government 24 186 to say that he deserved to be evicted. if the term had not expired the tenant would have been entitled to continue in possession even if the exemption were granted. learned counsel for the appellant urged that the high court had failed to notice that the present case was one where there was a contest between two tenants and not between a landlord and a tenant and that they erred in approximating the position of the appellant to that of the landlord.", "completion": ". for the following reasons: (1)when the high court offered in 1940 to lease out the premises in question for a period of 21 years, sri chettiar elected to take it on lease only for a period of seven years, which expired in 1947.\nj. irani would have got possession in the ordinary course as per high court 's order and the terms of the lease deed.\nj. irani who had taken a valid lease under 185 the orders of the high court is that of a hard litigant seeking to exploit the letter of the law without much regard to bona fides; and (5)sri chettiar had already managed to be in possession of the building for five more years than he was legitimately entitled to be.\" the learned judges of the high court held that the reasons which led the government to grant the exemption were not those which were countenanced by the policy or purpose of the act and that the order of exemption was, therefore, invalid.\nin doing so the learned judges said: \"reasons 1, 2 and 4 go together and have refe rence to the order of the high court in 1940 directing the receivers to execute a lease for seven years to the appellant and after the expiry of that period to grant a lease for fourteen years to the second respondents father.\nthat could be said of thousands of cases in which the leases in favour of tenants have expired and, but for the act the owners would be entitled to obtain possession of the demised premises."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: we bee no force in this contention, because a lessee of the reversion stands in the same position as a landlord and cannot have any higher rights, nor can the appellant derive any assistance from the fact that the second respondent declined to be a lessee for any term longer than seven years when that option was offered to him by the high court in april may, 1940. the position of the second respondent cannot be worse than if he had taken a lease for a definite term of seven years with a covenant to restore possession at the end of the period. the fact that in may 1940, the second respondent had an option to take a lease for a longer term, but of which he did not avail himself, does not make any difference or render that a ground for withdrawing from him the protection of the statute. we also agree with the learned judges of the high court that ground no. 3 is not germane for granting an exemption. as was pointed out, \"the important point to be considered by the government was whether the appellant had not other theatres at which he could carry on the business which he was carrying on at the gaiety theatre\", and this they omitted to consider. the reason why the possession of the tenant whose term had expired was afforded statutory protec tion was his inability to secure alternative accommodation in which either to reside in the case of residential buildings or to carry on the business which he was carrying on in the case of non residential buildings. this was therefore a relevant matter which the government had failed to take into account. the high court characterised reason no. 5 as really not a reason at all and we agree with this observation. the 187 statute had admittedly conferred upon tenants, such as the second respondent the right to continue in possession after the termination of the lease in their favour, and the fact that such a tenant had exercised the rights conferred upon him by statute was certainly not an improper conduct meriting his being deprived of the statutory protection afforded by section 7. the learned judges further pointed out that the order of government was defective, in that it had not taken into account several relevant matters as for instance the second respondent expending considerable sums to carry out improvements to the theatre in 1949 etc. which bore upon the exercise of their power, and which if taken into account would have weighed against the grant of the exemption. in view however of the conclusion reached that the reasons assigned by government for their order were not germane to the policy and purpose of the fact, we do not consider it necessary to pursue the matter further. the further point urged regarding the learned judges of the high court having erroneously constituted themselves into a court of appeal need not detain us long. the short answer to it is that the learned judges had not done so. the submission ignores the distinction between findings on facts which the court in proceedings under article 226 must, save in very exceptional cases, accept as correct and the relevance of those facts for considering whether their establishment satisfied the grounds necessary for the exercise of the power vested in government under section 13 of the act. for instance in the case on hand, no fact found by the government or stated by them as the reason or reasons which induced them to grant the exemption were even challenged before the high court, the only contention urged by the second respondent which was accepted by the high court, being that these facts were irrelevant for justifying the order. the appeal accordingly fails and is dismissed with costs to the contesting second respondent. sarkar. , j. in this judgment we propose to deal only with one of the two questions that arise in this appeal. 188 of these two questions, the first is whether section 13 'of the madras buildings (lease and rent control) ' act, 1949, offends article 14 of the constitution. that act makes provision, among other things, for controlling rents chargeable by landlords and for preventing unreasonable eviction of tenants. section 13, the validity of which is challenged, gives the state government power to exempt any building from all or any of the provisions of this act. the contention was that this section gave arbitrary power to the government to apply the law with unequal band as it did not furnish any guidance as to how the power to exempt was to be exercised. this question has been discussed fully by our brother ayyangar. we agree with the view taken by him that the section does not offend the article. we have nothing further to add to what he has said on this aspect of the case. the other question is whether the power was duly exercised in the present case. on this question we have arrived at a conclusion different from that which has found favour with our brother ayyangar. this is the question that we propose to discuss in this judgment. the power was exercised by an order made by the government on june 4, 1952. it exempted from the operation of the act certain premises used as a cinema house and called the gaiety theatre. the second respondent who was a tenant of the premises, was thereby deprived of the protection from eviction which he would have otherwise had under the act. he, therefore, moved the high court at madras for a writ to quash this order.", "completion": "we bee no force in this contention, because a lessee of the

respondent, took the view that the order had been passed for,reasons not germane to the purpose for which the power of exemption under section 13 had been vested in government, and quashed that order. this appeal is against this decision of the high court. the circumstances in which the order came to be made were these. one sir hajee ismail sait had a certain plot of land in the city of madras. he granted a 189 lease of that land sometime in 1914 to one venkiah for constructing a cinema house on it. it is not clear whether venkiah himself constructed any cinema house. it appears that he became insolvent and his assets, including the leasehold interest, vested in the official assignee who obtained an extension of the lease for a period of nine years from 1926 from the representatives of sir hajee ismail sait, who had died in the meantime. one mrs. madan purchased the lease hold interest from the official assignee and she later obtained a fresh lease from the representatives of sir hajee ismail sait for a period of seven years from june 1935, expiring on may 30, 1942. this lease gave mrs. madan the first option of refusal in case the lessor desired to let out the land on lease after its expiry. on january 4, 1937, the second respondent purchased from mrs. madan the lease hold right, including the superstructure of a cinema house which had by that time been constructed on the land by one of the previous lessees. this is the cinema house which came to be known as the gaiety theatre. the term of the lease was due to expire on may 30, 1942. in or about 1939, certain suits appear to have been instituted in the high court at madras in its original jurisdiction for the administration of the estate of sir hajee ismail sait. in those suits, orders had been passed appointing receivers of that estate and the estate was thereafter being administered by the high court. it appears that by the side of the gaiety theatre premises there was another plot of vacant land belonging to the same estate which was not bringing in any income. the high court passed orders that that land should also be let out on a long term lease. the father of the appellant offered to take a lease of that land at a rent of rs. 450 per month for a period of twenty one years with an option of renewal for another ten years, for the purpose of constructing a show house on it. this was sometime in 1940. at that time the lease of the adjoining gaiety theatre bad only about two more years to run. the appellant 's father did not like a competing showhouse in close 190 proximity to his own, and therefore, he suggested to the receivers that he should be given the lease of the gaiety theatre premises also after the expiry of the second respondent 's lease on may 30, 1942, at the same rent which was being paid by the second respondent and for a term ending with his proposed lease in respect of the adjoining premises. the proposals were put up by the receivers to the high court for its consideration. the high court thereupon called upon the second respondent to elect whether he would take a fresh lease of the gaiety theatre premises for a period of twenty one years after the expiry of his lease then current. this was done as he had the option under his lease. the second respondent was not prepared to take a fresh lease for twenty one years but he suggested that a lease for another seven years might be given to him on his agreeing to vacate the premises after the expiry of those seven years without claiming any extension or option. the proposals from the appellant 's father and the second respondent were then considered by the high court and by consent of parties orders were passed by it on march 21, 1940, and the 2nd and 3rd of may, 1940. by these orders the receivers were directed to grant a lease of the land adjoining the gaiety theatre premises to the appellant 's father for twenty one years commencing from may 1, 1940, with option for ten more years. these orders further directed the receivers to grant a lease of the gaiety theatre premises to the second respondent for a period of seven years from the same date without any option, and to grant a lease of these premises to the appellant 's father for a period of thirteen years and eleven months and a half commencing from the expiry of the seven years for which a lease of them was going to be granted to the second respondent. the orders required the appellant 's father to deposit a security of rs. 10,000 in respect of the leases to be granted to him and this he duly deposited. all these leases were then granted by the receivers under the orders of the court. apparently, the second respondent surrendered the remaining term of his lease which 191 was to have expired on may 30, 1942.

(3) sri chettiar is only an absentee lessee and he is having several other businesses in south india. (4) the conduct of sri chidambaram chettiar in (4) sri chettiar had already managed to be in refusing to surrender the possession of th e building to sri p. j. irani who had taken a valid lease under the orders of the high court is that of hard litigant seeking to exploit the letter of the law without much regard to bona fides; and (5)sri chettiar had already managed to be in possession of the building for five more years than he was legitimately entitled to be.\" the high court having considered the reasons came to the conclusion that they did not serve the purpose of the act. we are unable to accept this view. it may be that some of the reasons given would not have justified the order but broadly, we think, they referred to facts which showed that the power had been exercised legitimately. indeed, on the facts of this case which we have set out earlier, we think that it was unnecessary for the high court to ask the government to state the reasons for its order. in our view, these facts themselves sufficiently show that the order was within the objects of the act and not extraneous to section 13. we wish to observe before we proceed further, that in considering whether the reasons given by the government are sufficient to bring the order within the objects of the act, the high court had no power to act as if it were sitting in appeal over the government 's decision. a court cannot set aside an order under section 13 on the ground that it would not itself have made the order for the reasons for which the government had made it. all that the court has to see is whether the power was used for any extraneous purpose, that is to say, not for achieving the object for which the power had been granted. when it is alleged that the power was used for a purpose other than achieving the object for which the 193 power is granted, the initial onus must be on the party which alleges abuse of power and there must be prima facie evidence in support of the allegation. it is only then that the onus may shift. however all this may be, was the power in this case in fact used for an extraneous purpose? it is not said that the power had been exercised for any ulterior purpose. now, the purpose of the act, quite clearly, is to prevent unreasonable eviction and also to control rent. these two purposes are intertwined. an eviction becomes unreasonable where the object is to exploit the situation arising out of the dearth of accommodation by letting out the premises at an unreasonably high rent and on realisation of extortionate premium. often these are realised secretly, particularly so, the premium. therefore, when there is no risk of an opportunity arising in which a landlord may be able to realise illegal rent or premium, an eviction may not be unreasonable; indeed, there may be circumstances which would justify the inference that the tenant is trying to take an undue advantage of the situation and in such a case, the government would be justified and within its power to exempt the premises from the operation of the act. that is the position here.", "completion": "on october 1, 1946, the act came into force and in view of its provisions, the second respondent could not be evicted from the gaiety theatre premises even after the expiry of his lease.\nwhen the high court offered in 1940 to lease out the premises in question for a period of 21 years, sri chettiar elected to take it on lease only for a period of seven years, which expired in 1947.\nj. irani would have got possession in the ordinary course as per high court 's order and the terms of the lease deed.\nj. irani who had taken a valid lease under the orders of the high court is that of hard litigant seeking to exploit the letter of the law without much regard to bona fides; and (5)sri chettiar had already managed to be in possession of the building for five more years than he was legitimately entitled to be.\" the high court having considered the reasons came to the conclusion that they did not serve the purpose of the act.\nindeed, on the facts of this case which we have set out earlier, we think that it was unnecessary for the high court to ask the government to state the reasons for its order.\nin our view, these facts themselves sufficiently show that the order was within the objects of the act and not extraneous to section 13.\nwe wish to observe before we proceed further, that in considering whether the reasons given by the government are sufficient to bring the order within the objects of the act, the high court had no power to act as if it were sitting in appeal over the government 's decision.\ntherefore, when there is no risk of an opportunity arising in which a landlord may be able to realise illegal rent or premium, an eviction may not be unreasonable; indeed, there may be circumstances which would justify the inference that the tenant is trying to take an undue advantage of the situation and in such a case, the government would be justified and within its power to exempt the premises from the operation of the act."}

court was delivered by raghubar dayal, j. this appeal, by special leave, is against the order of the punjab high court dismissing the appellant 's appeal against his conviction under section 307, indian penal code. bimla devi, p. w. 7, was married to the appellant in october, 1951. their relations got strained by 1953 and she went to her brother 's place and stayed there for about a year, when she returned to her husband 's place at the assurance of the appellant 's maternal uncle that she would not be maltreated in future. she was, however, ill treated and her health deteriorated due to alleged maltreatment and deliberate undernourishment. in 1956, she was deliberately starved and was not allowed to leave the house and only sometimes a morsel or so used to be thrown to her as alms are given to beggars. she was denied food for days together and used to be given gram husk mixed in water after five or six days. she managed to go out of the house in april 1956, but romesh chander and suresh chander, brothers of the appellant, caught 256 hold of her and forcibly dragged her inside the house where she was severely beaten. thereafter, she was kept locked inside a room. on june 5, 1956, she happened to find her room unlocked, her mother in law and husband away and, availing of the opportunity, went out of the house and managed to reach the civil hospital, ludhiana, where she met lady doctor mrs. kumar, p. w. 2, and told her of her sufferings. the appellant and his mother went to the hospital and tried their best to take her back to the house, but were not allowed to do so by the lady doctor. social workers got interested in the matter and informed the brother of bimla devi, one madan mohan, who came down to ludhiana and, after learning all facts, sent information to the police station by letter on june 16, 1956. in his letter he said: \"my sister bimla devi sharma is lying in death bed. her condition is very serious. i am told by her that deliberate attempt has been made by her husband, mother in law and brother in law and sister in law. i was also told that she was kept locked in a room for a long time and was beaten by all the above and was starved. i therefore request that a case may be registered and her statement be recorded, immediately. \" the same day, at 9 15 p.m., dr. miss dalbir dhillon sent a note to the police saying 'my patient bimla devi is actually ill. she may collapse any moment '. shri sehgal, magistrate, p.w. 9, recorded her statement that night and stated in his note: \"blood transfusion is taking place through the right forearm and consequently the right hand of the patient is not free. it is not possible to get the thumb impression of the right hand thumb of the patient. that is why i have got her left hand thumb impression. \" the impression formed by the learned judge of the high court on seeing the photographs taken of bimla devi a few days later, is stated thus in the judgment: \"the impression i formed on looking at the two 257 photographs of bimla was that at that time she appeared to be suffering from extreme emaciation. her cheeks appeared to be hollow. the projecting bones of her body with little flesh on them made her appearance skeletal. the countenance seemed ' to be cadaverous.\" after considering the evidence of bimla devi and the doctors, the learned judge came to the conclusion: \"so far as the basic allegations are concerned, which formed the gravamen of the offence, the veracity of her statement cannot be doubted. after a careful scrutiny of her statement, i find her allegations as to starvation, maltreatment, etc., true. the exaggerations and omissions to which my attention was drawn in her statement are inconsequential. \" after considering the entire evidence on record, the learned judge said: \"after having given anxious thought and careful consideration to the facts and circumstances as emerge from the lengthy evidence on the record, i cannot accept the argument of the learned counsel for the accused, that the condition of acute emacia tion in which bimla devi was found on 5th of june, 1956, was not due to any calculated starvation but it was on account of prolonged illness, the nature of which was not known to the accused till dr. gulati had expressed his opinion that she was suffering from tuberculosis.\" he further stated: \"the story of bimla devi as to how she was illtreated, and how, her end was attempted to be brought about or precipitated, is convincing, despite the novelty of the method in which the object was sought to be achieved. the conduct of the accused and of his mother on 5th of june, 1956, when soon after bimla devi 's admission in the hospital they insisted on taking her back home, is significant and almost tell tale. it

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: \" 258 the appellant was acquitted of the offence under s.342, indian penal code, by the additional sessions judge, who gave him the benefit of doubt, though he had come to the conclusion that bimla devi 's movements were restricted to a certain extent. the learned judge of the high court considered this question and came to a different conclusion. having come to these findings, the learned judge considered the question whether on these facts an offence under section 307, indian penal code, had been established or not. he held it proved. mr. sethi, learned counsel for the appellant, has challenged the correctness of this view in law. he concedes that it is only when a person is helpless and is unable to look after himself that the person having control over him is legally bound to look after his requirements and to see that he is adequately fed. such persons, according to him, are infants, old people and lunatics. he contends that it is no part of a husband 's duty to spoon feed his wife,, his duty being simply to provide funds and food. in view of the finding of the court below about bimla devi 's being confined and being deprived of regular food in pursuance of a scheme of regularly starving her in order to accelerate her end, the responsibility of the appellant for the condition to which she was brought up to the 5th of june, 1956, is clear. the findings really go against any suggestion that the appellant had actually provided food and funds for his wife bimla devi. the next contention for the appellant is that the ingredients of an offence under section 307 are materially different from the ingredients of an offence under section 511, indian penal code. the difference is that for an act to amount to the commission of the offence of attempting to commit an offence, it need not be the last act and can be the first act towards the commission of the offence, while for an offence under section 307, it is the last act which, if effective to cause death, would constitute the offence of an attempt to commit murder. the contention really is that even if bimla devi had been deprived of food for a certain period, the act of so depriving her does not come under section 307, 250 as that act could not, by itself, have caused her death, it being necessary for the period of starvation to continue for a longer period to cause death. we do not agree with this contention. section 307 of the indian penal code reads: \"whoever does any act with such intention or knowledge, and under such circumstances that, if he by that act caused death, he would be guilty of murder, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine; and, if hurt is caused to any person by such act, the offender shall be liable either to imprisonment for life, or to such punishment as is hereinbefore mentioned. when any person offending under this section is under sentence of imprisonment for life, he may, if hurt is caused, be punished with death. \" section 308 reads: \"whoever does any act with such intention or knowledge and under such circumstances that, if he by that act caused death, he would be guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both; and, if hurt is caused to any person by such act, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, or with fine, or with both.\" both the sections are expressed in similar language. if section 307 is to be interpreted as urged for the appellant, section 308 too should be interpreted that way. what ' ever may be said with respect to section 307, being exhaustive or covering all the cases of attempts to commit murder and section 511 not applying to any case of attempt to commit murder on account of its being applicable only to offences punishable with imprisonment for life or imprisonment, the same cannot be said with respect to the offence of attempt to commit culpable homicide punishable under section 308. an attempt to commit culpable homicide is punishable with imprisonment for a certain period and therefore but for its being expressly made an offence under section 308, it would have 260 fallen under section 511 which applies to all attempts to commit offences punishable with imprisonment where no express provisions are made by the code for the punishment of that attempt. it should follow that the ingredients of an offence of attempt to commit culpable homicide not amounting to murder should be the same as the ingredients of an offence of attempt to commit that offence under section 511. we have held this day in abhayanand mishra vs the state of bihar (1) that a person commits the offence of attempting to commit a particular offence, when he intends to commit that particular offence and, having made preparations and with the intention to commit that offence does an act towards its commission and that such an act need not be the penultimate act towards the commission of that offence, but must be an act during the course of committing such offence.", "completion": "the next contention for the appellant is that the ingredients of an offence under section 307 are materially different from the ingredients of an offence under section 511, indian penal code.\nsection 307 of the indian penal code reads: \"whoever does any act with such intention or knowledge, and under such circumstances that, if he by that act caused death, he would be guilty of murder, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine;

(ii) fraudulently or dishonestly induced the university to deliver any property to him; or (iii) had intentionally induced the university to permit him to sit at the m.a. examination which it would not have done if it was not so deceived and the giving of such permission by the university caused or was likely to cause damage or harm to the university in reputation. there is no doubt that the appellant, by making false statements about his being a graduate and a teacher, in the applications he had submitted to the university, did deceive the university and that his intention was to make the university give him permission and deliver to him the admission card which would have enabled him to sit for the m.a. examination. this card is 'property '. the appellant would therefore have committed the offence of 'cheating ' if the admission card had not been withdrawn due to certain information reaching the university. 245 we do not accept the contention for the appellant that the admission card has no pecuniary value and is therefore not 'property '. the admission card as such has no pecuniary value, but it has immense value to the candidate for the examination. without it he cannot secure admission to the examination hall and consequently cannot appear at the examination. in queen empress vs appasami (1) it was held that the ticket entitling the accused to enter the examination room and be there examined for the matriculation test of the university was 'property '. in queen empress vs soshi bhushan (2) it was held that the term 'property ' in section 463, indian penal code, included the written certificate to the effect that the accused had attended, during a certain period, a course of law lectures and had paid up his fees.", "completion": "the appellant applied to the patna university for permission to appear at the 1954 m.\ninquiries were made and it was found that the certificates attached to the application were forged, that the appellant was not a graduate and was not a teacher and that in fact he had been de barred from taking any university examination for a certain number of years on account of his having committed corrupt practice at a university examination.\nthe appellant was acquitted of the charge of forging those certificates, but was convicted of the offence of attempting to cheat inasmuch as he, by false representations, deceived the university and induced the authorities to issue the admission card, which, if the fraud had not been detected, would have been ultimately delivered to the appellant.\nthe second is that even if the appellant had obtained the admission card and appeared at the m.\n\" the appellant would therefore have cheated the university if he had (i) deceived the university;

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: we need not therefore consider the alternative case regarding the possible commission of the offence of cheating by the appellant, by his inducing the university to permit him to sit for the examination, which it would not have done if it had known the true facts and the appellant causing damage to its reputation due to its permitting him to sit for the examination. we need not also therefore consider the further question urged for the appellant that the question of the university suffering in its reputation is not immediately connected with the accused 's conduct in obtaining the necessary permission. another contention for the appellant is that the facts proved do not go beyond the stage of reparation for the commission of the offence of `cheating ' and do not make out the offence of attempting to cheat. there is a thin line between the preparation for and an attempt to commit an offence. undoubtedly, a culprit first intends to commit the offence, then makes preparation for committing it and thereafter attempts to commit the offence. if the attempt succeeds, he has committed the offence; if it fails due to reasons beyond his control, he is said to have attempted to commit the offence. attempt to commit an offence, therefore, can be said to begin when the preparations (1) mad. 151. (2) all. 210, 246 are complete and the culpit commences to do something with the intention of committing the offence and which is a step towards the commission of the offence. the moment he commences to do an act with the necessary intention, he commences his attempt to commit the offence. this is clear from the general expression 'attempt to commit an offence ' and is exactly what the provisions of section 511, indian penal code, require. the relevant portion of section 511 is: \"whoever attempts to commit an offence punish able by this code. . or to cause such an offence to be committed and in such attempt does any act towards the commission of the offence, shall, where no express provision is made by this code for the punishment of such attempt, be punished. . \" these provisions require that it is only when one, firstly, attempts to commit an offence and, secondly, in such attempt, does any act towards the commission of the offence, that he is punishable for that attempt to commit the offence. it follows, therefore, that the act which would make the culprit 's attempt to commit an offence punishable, must be an act which, by itself, or in combination with other acts, leads to the commission of the offence. the first step in the commission of the offence of cheating, therefore, must be an act which would lead to the deception of the person sought to be cheated. the moment a person takes some step to deceive the person sought to be cheated, he has embarked on a course of conduct which is nothing less than an attempt to commit the offence, as contemplated by section 511. he does the act with the intention to commit the offence and the act is a step towards the commission of the offence. it is to be borne in mind that the question whether a certain act amounts to an attempt to commit a particular offence is a question of fact dependent on the nature of the offence and the steps necessary to take in order to commit it. no exhaustive precise definition of what would amount to an attempt to commit an offence is possible. the cases referred to make this clear. 247 we may refer to some decided cases on the construction of section 511, indian penal code. in the queen vs ramsarun chowbey (1) it was said at p. 47: \"to constitute then the offence of attempt under this section (section 511), there must be an act done with the intention of committing an offence, and for the purpose of committing that offence, and it must be done in attempting the commission of the offence. two illustrations of the offence of attempt as defined in this section are given in the code; both are illustrations of cases in which the offence has been committed. in each we find an act done with the intent of committing an offence and immediately enabling the commission of the offence, although it was not an act which constituted a part of the offence,, and in each we find the intention of the person making the attempt was frustrated by circumstances independent of his own volition. from the illustrations it may be inferred that the legislature did not mean that the act done must be itself an ingredient (so to say) of the offence attempted. . the learned judge said, further, at p. 49: \"i regard that term (attempt) as here employed as indicating the actual taking of those steps which lead immediately to the commission of the offence, although nothing be done, or omitted, which of itself is a necessary constituent of the offence attempted\". we do not agree that the 'act towards the commission of such offence ' must be 'an act which leads immediately to the commission of the offence '. the purpose of the illustration is not to indicate such a construction of the section, but to point out that the culprit has done all that be necessary for the commission of the offence even though he may not actually succeed in his object and commit the offence. the learned judge himself emphasized this by observing at p. 48: \"the circumstances stated in the illustrations to (1) (1872) 4 n.w.p. 46.", "completion": "the moment he commences to do an act with the necessary intention, he commences his attempt to commit the offence.\n. or to cause such an offence to be committed and in such attempt does any act towards the commission of the offence, shall, where no express provision is made by this code for the punishment of such attempt, be punished.\n. \" these provisions require that it is only when one, firstly, attempts to commit an offence and, secondly, in such attempt, does any act towards the commission of the offence, that he is punishable for that attempt to commit the offence.\nit follows, therefore, that the act which would make the culprit 's attempt to commit an offence punishable, must be an act which, by itself, or in combination with other acts, leads to the commission of the offence.\n47: \"to constitute then the offence of attempt under this section (section 511), there must be an act done with the intention of committing an offence, and for the purpose of committing that offence, and it must be done in attempting the commission of the offence.\nin each we find an act done with the intent of committing an offence and immediately enabling the commission of the offence, although it was not an act which constituted a part of the offence,, and in each we find the intention of the person making the attempt was frustrated by circumstances independent of his own volition."}

have been heard together and this judgment will govern them all. they raise a common question as to the practice of this court, which we shall presently state. but before we do so, we must first set out the facts in so far as it is necessary to state them in order to appreciate the precise nature of the question that has arisen for consideration in these appeals. the relevant facts are these. the firm of messrs. durga dutt chandi prasad, appellant in these appeals, carried on a business of dealing in several kinds of goods but mostly in raw jute at sahebganj in bihar. it was registered as a dealer under section 4 of the bihar sales tax act, 1944, with effect from july 1, 1946. for three periods, commencing from october 1, 1947 and ending on march 31, 1950, it was assessed to sales tax on its turnover of the relevant periods, which consisted inter alia of purchases alleged, to have made on behalf of two other jute mills outside bihar, namely, the raigarh jute mills and the bengal jute mills, and also of dispatches of jute said to have been made to the dealer 's own firm in calcutta for sale in calcutta. for the assessment period commencing on october 1, 1947 and ending on march 31, 1948 the appellant claimed a deduction of (a) rs. 6,58,880 5 9 on the ground that the said amount represented purchases made on behalf of the aforesaid two jute mills, and (b) rs. 1,62,662 13 3 being despatches of jute made to the dealer 's own firm in calcutta. similarly, for the next assessment period commencing on april 1, 1948 and ending on march 31, 1949 the appellant claimed a deduction of certain amounts (the exact amounts being 279 irrelevant for our purpose) on the two grounds mentioned above from the relevant turnover. the claim of the appellant was that purchases made on behalf of the two jute mills aforesaid and the despatches of jute made to the appellant 's own firm in calcutta were not `sales ' within the meaning of the bihar sales tax act, 1947 (hereinafter called the act). for the third period of assessment commencing on april 1, 1949 and ending on march 31, 1950 a similar claim was made. but for this period there was an additional claim with regard to the sale of mustard seed worth rs. 1,00,513 119 to messrs. panna lal binjraj for which the appellant claimed a deduction. on june 7, 1951 the sales tax officer concerned disallowed the claim of the appellant for the first two periods and by an order dated april 17, 1953, the claim for the third period was also disallowed. the appellant then preferred appeals under the relevant provisions of the act. these appeals were heard by the deputy commissioner of commercial taxes,, bihar, and were dismissed by him. then the appellant filed applications in revision under section 24 of the act to the board of revenue, bihar. the board by its orders dated august 20, 1953, and september 3, 1953, dismissed the petitions of revision relating to the first two periods and by its orders dated april 30, 1954, also dismissed the petition of revision relating to the third period. under section 25(1) of the act the appellant moved the board to state a case to the high court of patna on certain questions of law which, according to the appellant, arose out of the orders passed. the board, however, refused to state a case inasmuch as in its opinion no questions of law arose out of the orders passed. the board expressed the view that the two questions, namely, (1) whether the despatch of jute outside the state of bihar was a sale within the meaning of the act and (2) whether the purchases said to have been made on behalf of the two mills outside bihar were liable to tax, were both concluded by findings of fact arrived at by the competent authorities on relevant materials in the record and were no longer open to challenge. the appellant then 280 moved the high court for requiring the board to state a case on the questions of law which, according to the appellant, arose out of the orders passed with regard to the first two periods of assessment. by an order dated november 17, 1954, the high court dismissed the two applications made to it for requiring the board to state a case to the high court with regard to the said two periods. on a similar application made by the appellant to the high court with regard to the third period of assessment, the high court directed the board of revenue to state a case on the following question: \"whether the petitioner is entitled to claim a deduction on account of sale of mustard seed to the extent of rs. 1,00,513 11 9 to messrs. panna lal binjraj as

from october 1, 1947 and ending on march 31, 1950, it was assessed to sales tax on its turnover of the relevant periods, which consisted inter alia of purchases alleged, to have made on behalf of two other jute mills outside bihar, namely, the raigarh jute mills and the bengal jute mills, and also of dispatches of jute said to have been made to the dealer 's own firm in calcutta for sale in calcutta.\nsimilarly, for the next assessment period commencing on april 1, 1948 and ending on march 31, 1949 the appellant claimed a deduction of certain amounts (the exact amounts being 279 irrelevant for our purpose) on the two grounds mentioned above from the relevant turnover.\nthe claim of the appellant was that purchases made on behalf of the two jute mills aforesaid and the despatches of jute made to the appellant 's own firm in calcutta were not `sales ' within the meaning of the bihar sales tax act, 1947 (hereinafter called the act).\non june 7, 1951 the sales tax officer concerned disallowed the claim of the appellant for the first two periods and by an order dated april 17, 1953, the claim for the third period was also disallowed.\nunder section 25(1) of the act the appellant moved the board to state a case to the high court of patna on certain questions of law which, according to the appellant, arose out of the orders passed.\nthe board expressed the view that the two questions, namely, (1) whether the despatch of jute outside the state of bihar was a sale within the meaning of the act and (2) whether the purchases said to have been made on behalf of the two mills outside bihar were liable to tax, were both concluded by findings of fact arrived at by the competent authorities on relevant materials in the record and were no longer open to challenge.\nthe appellant then 280 moved the high court for requiring the board to state a case on the questions of law which, according to the appellant, arose out of the orders passed with regard to the first two periods of assessment.\non a similar application made by the appellant to the high court with regard to the third period of assessment, the high court directed the board of revenue to

the position is quite clear. with regard to two of the assessment orders the high court held that no questions of law arose at all; with regard to the third assessment order the high court held that only one question of law arose and it answered 282 that question against the appellant. can the appellant now ignore these orders of the high court and ask us to consider on merits the orders of the board of revenue passed on the two revision applications for the first two periods and the orders of the board in the reference case holding that no question of law arose out of the assessment order for the third period? this is the question, taken as a preliminary point, which we have to answer in these three appeals. the question has to be considered with regard to (a) the scope and ambit of article 136 of the constitution; (b) the practice of this court; and (c) the question must also be considered in the context of the scheme of the act under which the assessments were made, appeals and revisions in respect thereof were heard, and the scope and effect of section 25 of the act under which the board was asked to refer certain alleged questions of law to the high court and the high court was asked to direct the board to state a case on the questions of law said to arise out of the assessment orders. it is necessary at this stage to dispose of an initial point taken on behalf of the appellant, before we go to a consideration of the main question. the point is this. on behalf of the appellant it has been submitted that leave having been granted by this court, the preliminary objection taken to the hearing of the appeals should not be entertained now and the appeals should be heard on merits. we are unable to accept this as correct. in these cases leave was granted without hearing the respondents, and full materials in the record were not available nor placed before the court when leave was granted.", "completion": "no application was made for leave to appeal, nor was any leave granted, with regard to the subsequent orders made by the board refusing to state a case or the orders of the high court refusing the application of the appellant to direct the board to state a case.\nwith regard to the third period of assessment regarding which the high court had directed the board to state a case on a particular question of law and had actually answered it, the appellant again made an application for special leave to appeal on april 12, 1955, and this court granted leave to the appellant by an order dated december 23, 1955, the leave granted being confined to the order of the board of revenue dated august 30, 1954, by which the board decided that no questions of law arose for a reference to the high court.\nagain, the appellant neither asked for nor obtained any leave to appeal from the subsequent orders of the high court by which the high court held that only one question of law arose out of the orders passed with regard to the third period of assessment and directed the board to state a case on that question.\non the facts stated above the question which has arisen is whether as a matter of practice of this court, the appellant is enticed to be heard on merits in the three appeals when special leave was neither asked for nor granted in respect of the subsequent orders of the high court relating to the assessments in question which have now become final between the parties thereto.\ncan the appellant now ignore these orders of the high court and ask us to consider on merits the orders of the board of revenue passed on the two revision applications for the first two periods and the orders of the board in the reference case holding that no question of law arose out of the assessment order for the third period?"}

(2) of section 25 apply to the high court against such refusal. if the high court is not satisfied that such refusal was justified, it may require the board to state a case and refer it to the high court. when a case is referred to the high court, it decides the question of law raised thereby by a judgment containing the grounds on which the decision is founded. the board then disposes of the case according to the decision of the high court. this in short is the scheme of section 25. it is manifest that under this scheme questions of fact ate dealt with by the assessing authorities, subject to appeal and revision; but on questions of law the decision of the high court is the decision according to which the case has to be disposed of section 23 of the act says that save as provided in section 25, no 284 assessment made and no order passed under the act or the rules made thereunder by the commissioner or any person appointed under section 3 to assist him shall be called into question in any court and save as provided in section 24, no appeal or application for revision or review shall lie against any such assessment or order. clearly enough, sections 23, 24 and 25 of the act cannot override the provisions of the constitution, nor affect the power of this court under article 136 of the constitution. ' the decision of the high court under section 25 of the act is undoubtedly subject to the power of this court under article 136; so also the deter mination or order of any of the assessing authorities which are tribunals within the meaning of article 136. that article reads (omitting what is not relevant for our purpose): \"article 136. (1) notwithstanding anything in this chapter, the supreme court may, in its discretion, grant special leave to appeal from any judgment, decree, determination, sentence or order in any cause or matter passed or made by any court or tribunal in the territory of india. \" the words of the article are very general and it is stated in express terms that this court may, in its discretion, grant special leave to appeal from any judgment, decree, determination, sentence or order in any cause or matter passed or made by any court or tribunal in the territory of india. the question before us is not whether we have the power; undoubtedly, we have the power, but the question is whether in the circumstances under present consideration, it is a proper exercise of discretion to allow the appellant to have resort to the power of this court under article 136. that question must be decided on the facts of each case, having regard to the practice of this court and the limitations which this court itself has laid down with regard to the exercise of its discretion under article 136. what are these limitations in pritam singh vs the state (1) this court indicated the nature of these limitations in the following observations: (1) ; 285 \"on a careful examination of article 136 along with the preceding article, it seems clear that the wide discretionary power with which this court is invested under it is to be exercised sparingly and in exceptional cases only, and as far as possible a more or less uniform standard should be adopted in granting special leave in the wide range of matters which can come up before it under this article.", "completion": "under sub section (1) of section 25, the dealer or commissioner who is aggrieved by an order made by the board under sub section (4) of section 24 may by application in writing require the board to refer to the high court any question of law arising out of such an order; if for reason to be recorded in writing the board refuses to make such reference, the applicant may under subs.\nit is manifest that under this scheme questions of fact ate dealt with by the assessing authorities, subject to appeal and revision; but on questions of law the decision of the high court is the decision according to which the case has to be disposed of section 23 of the act says that save as provided in section 25, no 284 assessment made and no order passed under the act or the rules made thereunder by the commissioner or any person appointed under section 3 to assist him shall be called into question in any court and save as provided in section 24, no appeal or application for revision or review shall lie against any such assessment or order.\nclearly enough, sections 23, 24 and 25 of the act cannot override the provisions of the constitution, nor affect the power of this court under article 136 of the constitution.\n' the decision of the high court under section 25 of the act is undoubtedly subject to the power of this court under article 136; so also the deter mination or order of any of the assessing authorities which are tribunals within the meaning of article 136.\n\" the words of the article are very general and it is stated in express terms that this court may, in its discretion, grant special leave to appeal from any judgment, decree, determination, sentence or order in any cause or matter passed or made by any court or tribunal in the territory of india."}

those orders have dow become final and binding on the parties thereto. what the appellant is seeking to do now is to by pass the high court by ignoring its orders. this the appellant cannot be allowed to do. far from there being any special cir cumstances in favour of the appellant, there are plenty of circumstances against him. the appellant is really trying to go behind the orders of the high court by preferring these appeals directly from the orders of the board of revenue, and in one appeal from the orders of the board refusing to make a reference to the high court. the practice of this court is also against the appellant. the earliest decision on this point is that of dhakeswari cotton mills ltd.(1) and learned counsel for the appellant has relied on it in support of his argument that this court had in some previous cases interfered with an order of the tribunal in exercise of its power under article 136 even though the assessee had not moved against the order of the high court. in dhakeswari 's case (1) what happened was this. the assessee having exhausted all his remedies under the income tax act, 1922, including that under section 66(2) for the issue of a mandamus to the tribunal, made an (1) ; 287 application to this court for special leave to appeal against the order of the tribunal; this court granted special leave and in the appeal filed in pursuance thereof quashed the order of the tribunal. but the decision in dhakeswari 's case (1) must be read in the light of the special circumstances which existed there. it was found by this court that the tribunal had violated certain fundamental rules of just ice in reaching its conclusions, and that the assessee had not had a fair hearing; therefore, it was held that it was a fit case for the exercise of the power under article 136. the decision proceeded really on the basis that the principles of natural justice had been violated and there was in reality no fair trial. in the appeals before us no such or similar ground is alleged so as to attract the exercise of our power under article 136. in moti ram v. commissioner of income tax (2) the appellant did not make any application under section 66(2) of the income tax act, 1922, but obtained special leave of this court in respect of the order of the tribunal in the special circumstance that his property was attached and proceeded against for the recovery of the tax. the question of the propriety of the grant of special leave was not considered, but the appeal was dismissed on merits. the decision in jogta coal co. ltd. vs commissioner of income tax, west bengal (3) which is a decision on its own facts, has been open to much debate.", "completion": "the only uniform standard which in our opinion can be laid down in the circumstances is that the court should grant special leave to appeal only in those cases where special circumstances are shown to exist.\ngenerally speaking, this court wilt not grant special leave, unless it is shown that exceptional and special circumstances exist, that substantial and grave injustice has been done and that the case in question presents features of sufficient gravity to warrant a review of the decision appealed against.\nas we have pointed out earlier, the decision of the high court in respect of all the three assessment orders was no doubt subject to an appeal to this court if this court gave special leave under article 136.\nthe earliest decision on this point is that of dhakeswari cotton mills ltd.(1) and learned counsel for the appellant has relied on it in support of his argument that this court had in some previous cases interfered with an order of the tribunal in exercise of its power under article 136 even though the assessee had not moved against the order of the high court.\nthe assessee having exhausted all his remedies under the income tax act, 1922, including that under section 66(2) for the issue of a mandamus to the tribunal, made an (1) ;

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: then, after referring to an unsuccessful attempt on the part of the plaintiffs to obtain a certificate under section 9 of the act ' the plaintiffs refer to a letter dated november 16, 1947, written by the first defendant to the plaintiff8 intimating that she had from that day sublet the flat to the second defendant. it is stated in para,graphs 12 and 13 of the plaint that on december 19, 1947, the second defendant sent a cheque for rs. 370 for rent , for the month of november, 1947, but the plaintiffs declined to accept the same or to recognise the second defendant as a lawful occupant as subtenant or otherwise. it is also alleged that on january 23, 1948, the plaintiffs gave a notice to both ,the codefendants to vacate the premises at the end of february 29, 1948. in paragraphs 14 and 15 the plaintiffs formulate the grounds for ejectment, ,namely, (1) that the alleged subletting by the first ,defendant to the second defendant was wrongful, illegal and in breach of the terms of the tenancy and 30 230 (2)that the plaintiffs required the premises reasonably and bona fide for the use and occupation of two of the beneficiaries. the plaintiffs prayed that both the defendants be ordered to vacate the premises and that both of them be ordered to pay to the plaintiffs compensation for the use and occupation of the premises at rs. 370 per mouth from november 1, 1947, till delivery of vacant possession. the appellant points out that on the face of the plaint the plaintiffs declined to recognise it as a lawful occupant as subtenant or otherwise and treated it as a mere trespasser having no lawful claim to the demised flat and, therefore, the suit, in so far as it was one between the plaintiffs and the appellant (the second defendant), cannot be said to be a suit between a landlord and a tenant and that the suit in so far as it claimed compensation from him cannot be said to be a suit for recovery of rent. the last part of the contention need not detain us long, for the suit was undoubtedly one for possession of the flat and the claim for compensation was only incidental and ancillary to to the claim for possession. jurisdiction to entertain a suit for possession will empower the court not only to pass a decree for possession but also to give directions for payment of mesne profits until delivery of possession. such direction for payment of mesne profits is usually an integral part of the decree for possession. the only question for consideration, therefore, is whether the suit was one between a landlord and a tenant. the respondents (the plaintiffs) do not contend that the appellant (the second defendant) is a 'tenant\" as defined in section 5 (11) of the act. the appellant, on the other hand, does not and, indeed, cannot ;deny that, as between the plaintiffs and the first defendant, the suit is one between a landlord and a tenant and as such the small causes court is, under section 28 of the act, the only court competent to entertain the suit. section 28 confers jurisdiction on the court of small causes not only to entertain and try any suit or proceeding between a landlord and a 231 tenant relating to the recovery of rent or possession of the premises but also \"to deal with any claim or question arising out of this act or any of its provisions. there is no reason to hold that ' \"any claim or question\" must necessarily be one between the landlord and the tenant. in any case, once there is a suit between a landlord and a tenant relating to the recovery of rent or possession of the premises the small causes court acquires the jurisdiction not only to entertain that suit but also \"to deal with any claim or question arising out of the act or any of its pro visions\" which may properly be raised in such a suit. the plaintiffs in this suit claimed that the purported subletting by the first defendant to the second defendant was unlawful both because it was a breach of the terms of the tenancy and also because as the statutory tenant after the determination of the contractual tenancy the first defendant was not entitled to create a sub tenancy and they questioned the validity of the second defendant 's claim to any protection under the act. the claim or question as to the respective rights of the plaintiffs and the second defendant thus raised in the plaint certaintly arises out of the act and the language of section 28 appears to be wide enough to cover the same. apart from that section, under the ordinary law a decree for possession passed against a tenant in a suit for ejectment is binding on a person claiming title under or through that tenant and is executable against such person whether or not he was or was not a party to the suit. the non joinder of such a person does not render the decree any the less binding on him. it is in this sense, therefore, that he is not a necessary party to an ejectment suit against the tenant.", "completion": "the appellant points out that on the face of the plaint the plaintiffs declined to recognise it as a lawful occupant as subtenant or otherwise

(1) of article 286. now, it is quite clear that from the operation of the charging section sales of a particular character are kept out. this provision saves from taxation all those transactions which, if they were taxed, would have fallen within the ban of article 286. the effect of this saving is to make such transactions immune from taxation, and no further amendment of the law in the machinery section was necessary. what section 15 does, is to grant an additional exemption in respect of sales in which the goods, though sold to a registered dealer, are meant for resale in the state, itself. it is quite easy to see that unless this exemption was granted, it was possible that there would have been sales tax at more than one point, namely, at the point at which the first registered dealer sold to the second regis tered dealer and again, when the second registered dealer sold in his turn. to avoid taxation at multiple points on transactions of sale of the same goods within the state, it was provided that the tax shall be paid only on the last sale and not on the previous sales, so long as the previous sales were from registered dealers to registered dealers in respect of goods mentioned in the registration certificate of the latter and provided the goods were for resale in the state.", "completion": "in dealing with transactions such as these, this court pointed out that only sales which affected inter (1) ; 990 state trade or commerce directly and were an integral part thereof, were saved under article 286(2).\nit was observed in the case as follows: \"the argument on behalf of the petitioner is that, as the goods were purchased for the purpose of being sold to dealers outside the state, and they were, in fact, so sold, the purchases were in the course of inter state trade, and the levy of tax thereon was within the prohibition enacted by article 286(2).\nthe fact that the purchaser sold those very goods to dealers outside the state is not relevant, as those sales are distinct and separate from the sales on which the taxes in question have been im.\nthe former sales are in the course of inter state trade, and are not taxable under article 286(2), but the latter are purely intrastate sales, and tax imposed thereon does not offend article 286(2).\nnothing in sub section (1) shall, except in cases covered by the first proviso to sub section (12) of section 2 of this act, be deemed to 991 render any dealer liable to tax on the sale of goods where such sale takes place: (i) outside the state of assam; (ii) in the course of the import of the goods into, or export of the goods out of, the territory of india; or (iii) in the course of inter state trade or commerce except in so far as parliament may by law otherwise provide.\nto avoid taxation at multiple points on transactions of sale of the same goods within the state, it was provided that the tax shall be paid only on the last sale and not on the previous sales, so long as the previous sales were from registered dealers to registered dealers in respect of goods mentioned in the registration certificate of the latter and provided the goods were for resale in the state."}

(6) in entry 4(1) in the first schedule to the (1 of 1944). petitioners nos. 1 to 17 are tobacco cultivators and they carry on the trade and business of growing tobacco and of selling it in kaimganj tahsil in the district of farrukhabad in uttar pradesh. petitioners 18 to 30 are partners or proprietors or agents of firms which are private bonded warehouse licensees and they carry on trade and business of purchasing tobacco from the cultivators and of selling the same to dealers or to other private warehouse licensees. by their petition the petitioners have asked for a writ, direction or order in the nature of mandamus to be issued to the respondent, the union of india, restraining it from levying excise duty on hooka and chewing tobacco under the impugned item and any other writ, direction or order which may be found suitable to 120 protect the fundamental rights of the petitioners to carry on their trade and business of dealing in hooka and chewing tobacco. the attack against the validity of the impugned tariff item is based substantially on two grounds. it is urged that the rates imposed by the impugned item are excessive and they virtually destroy the petitioners ' trade and it is argued that the impugned item is based on unconstitutional discrimination. mr. mathur, for the petitioners, fairly conceded that he would not be able to substantiate the first ground of challenge, and indeed it is obvious that a challenge to tax law on the mere ground that the tariff imposed by the tax law is heavy cannot be enter tained. that leaves the question of discrimination alone to be considered in the present petition. for the purpose of this petition we will assume that if discrimination in respect of commodities taxed is proved it ultimately amounts to a discrimination against the persons taxed and therefore article 14 can be invoked in such a case. mr. mathur contends that is the effect of the decision of this court in kunmathat thathunni moopil nair, etc., vs the state of kerala (1) and as we have just observed we will assume that such a challenge can be made against the validity of a taxing statute with provisions such as we have before us and deal with the petition on that basis. the tariff entry in dispute as it now obtains under the taxing statute is entry 4 in the first schedule. it deals with tobacco. under this entry \"tobacco\" means any form of tobacco, whether cured or uncured and whether manufactured or not, and includes the leaf, stalks and stems of the tobacco plant, but does not include any part of a tobacco plant while still attached to the earth. clause i in entry 4 deals with unmanufactured tobacco and prescribes tariff per kilogram in respect of the several items specified in it. item (1) under this clause deals with five categories of tobacco which are flue cured and are used in the manufacture of cigarettes as indicated in the said five sub clauses. item (2) deals with tobacco which is flue cured and used for the manufacture of smoking (1) ; 121 mixtures for pipes and cigarettes. item (3) provides, for flue cured tobacco which is not otherwise specified; and item (4) is concerned with tobacco other than flue cured and used for the manufacture of (a) cigarettes or (b) smoking mixtures for pipes and cigarettes. the, tariff varies from rs. 16.15 np. per kilogram to ' rs. 1.65 np. per kilogram. that takes us to item (5). this item deals with tobacco other than flue cured and not actually used for the manufacture of (a) cigarettes or (b) smoking mixtures for pipes and cigarettes or (e) biris. the fourth clause under this item is tobacco cured in whole leaf form and packed or tied in bundles, banks or bunches or in the form of twists or coils. for tobacco falling under the four clauses under item (5) the tariff is rs. 1.10np. per kilogram. clause (6) in this item with which we are concerned in the present petition deals with tobacco other than flue cured and not otherwise specified. for this residuary clause the tariff prescribed is rs. 2.20 np. per kilogram. this tariff is double the tariff prescribed for the classes in the preceding item. mr. mathur 's grievance is that the tobacco with which the petitioners deal cannot be distinguished on any rational basis from the tobacco covered by item (5), cl. (4), and so the imposition of a double tariff on the tobacco in which the petitioners deal is invalid inasmuch as it is based on unconstitutional discrimination. the argument proceeds on the assumption that the tariff is prescribe by reference to the use to which tobacco is put and it is urged that the tobacco with which the petitioners are concerned is not actually used either for cigarettes or smoking mixtures or biris and the fact that it is broken and not whole leaf does not afford any rational basis for classification. in dealing with.", "completion": "by their petition the petitioners have asked for a writ, direction or order in the nature of mandamus to be issued to the respondent, the union of india, restraining it from levying excise duty on hooka and chewing tobacco under the impugned item and any other writ, direction or order which may be found suitable to 120 protect the fundamental rights of the petitioners to carry on their trade and business of dealing in hooka and chewing tobacco.\nclause i in entry 4 deals with unmanufactured tobacco and prescribes tariff per kilogram in respect of the several items specified in it.\nitem (1) under this clause deals with five categories of tobacco which are flue cured and are used in the manufacture of cigarettes as indicated in the said five sub clauses.\nitem (2) deals with tobacco which is flue cured and used for the manufacture of smoking (1) ; 121 mixtures for pipes and cigarettes.\nitem (3) provides, for flue cured tobacco which is not otherwise specified; and item (4) is concerned with tobacco other than flue cured and used for the manufacture of (a) cigarettes or (b) smoking mixtures for pipes and cigarettes.\nthis item deals with tobacco other than flue cured and not actually used for the manufacture of (a) cigarettes or (b) smoking mixtures for pipes and cigarettes or (e) biris.\nfor tobacco falling under the four clauses under item (5) the tariff is rs.\nclause (6) in this item with which we are concerned in the present petition deals with tobacco other than flue cured and not otherwise specified.\nmathur 's grievance is that the tobacco with which the petitioners deal cannot be distinguished on any rational basis from the tobacco covered by item (5), cl.\n(4), and so the imposition of a double tariff on the tobacco in which the petitioners deal is invalid inasmuch as it is based on unconstitutional discrimination."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: this argument it would be relevant very briefly to refer to the report of the tobacco expert committee whose recommendations have furnished the main basis for the present revised tariff in respect of tobacco. in substance this report shows that the present tariff cannot be said to have been prescribed either wholly or even primarily by reference actually to the use of tobacco. tobacco, as the 16 122 committee 's report points out, is a rich man 's solace and a poor man 's comfort. since it is used by all classes of people in various forms it is necessary to frame the tariff in such a way that the incidence of tax shall fall equitably on all classes of people using it. the report then points out that the intention tariff based on the principle of intention was found to be, ineffective because the assessee 's declaration of intended use left large room for evasion of tax. that is why the intention tariff was substituted by a flat rate of duty. by experience it was found that even this method was not very effective or equitable and then was adopted the capability tariff. under this test the criterion of assessment was to be whether or not a particular specimen of tobacco was capable of use in bird manufacturing. if so capable it was assessable on a higher rate, if not so capable then at a lower rate. the report has examined the advantages of the capability tariff and has quoted the opinion of the taxation enquiry committee which made its report in 1953. the report considered the volume of evidence adduced before it and took into account all the suggestions made. \"in view of the practical difficulties brought before us\", says the report, \"we consider that, within the present tariff, the only workable and satisfactory method of classifying tobacco will be to prescribe standards readily identifiable either visually or by other simple tests and manipulations with a view to determine empirically what is capable and what is incapable of use in biris. the position is complicated because the same tobacco is used for different purposes in different parts of the country according to the prevalent consumption habits of different types of tobacco\"; and the committee realised that any system of classification on a uniform basis for the whole of the indian union is bound to involve greater imposts on consumers of those areas where the prevalent custom is to consume a variety for chewing, snuff, hooka, cigar purposes while the same varieties are used in other areas for biris. the conclusion of the committee, therefore, 'was that the only criterion which is safe to adopt is the one relating to the physical form 123 of tobacco as affecting its suitability for biri making. the committee realised that it was very difficult to classify specified varieties as solely chewing tobacco because many of these varieties are also used for making snuff and for hooka purposes. normally, however, most chewing varieties are in whole leaf form and are ' cured by addition of moisture. tobacco cured in whole leaf form cannot be converted into flakes as readily as tobacco cured by dry curing methods, and in the opinion of the committee, although it is possible to prepare flakes out of tobacco cured in whole leaf form the process of conversion into flakes causes much higher proportions to crumble into dust, raw and other unsalable forms. the committee was conscious that the whole leaf varieties after suitable manipulation can be utilised for biri manufacturing purposes but it thought that this could be done only after converting them into graded flakes, and even thereafter only by admixture with other tobacco on a small localised scale. in regard to the broken leaf grades which the committee recommended should be liable to assessment at the higher rate relief was recommended by permitting any owner to convert his broken leaf tobacco into fine rawa or dust in which form it will become physically unusable for biris. according to the committee, after such manipulation of physical form, the resultant, if it fulfils the specifications for rawa and dust, may be allowed assessment at the lower rate. we have referred to these observations made by the committee in its report because they clearly and emphatically bring out the distinction between \"tobacco other than flue cured and not otherwise specified\" which is the subject matter of the, residuary clause and \"tobacco other than flue cured and not actually. used for the manufacture of cigarettes or smoking mixtures for pipes or cigarettes or biris\" covered by el. by the test of physical form the two articles are different. by the test of capability of user they are different and in a sense according to the committee 's recommendations they partake of the character of different commodities. in this connection it may be 124 pointed out that though the tariff impost on the tobacco falling under the impugned cl. (6) is much higher, biris in the manufacture of which no process has been conducted with the aid of machines operated with or without the aid of power are not subject to any tariff, whereas cigars, chewing, cigarettes and biris in the manufacture of which any process has been conducted with the aid of machines operated with or without the aid of power are subject to tariff. the problem which the committee had to face was to classify tobacco other than flue cured which would be used for the manufacture of biris, and with that object cl. (5) and el. (6) have been devised. therefore, in our opinion, the distinction between tobacco falling under cl.

custodian that dr. mohammed saeed had transferred a substantial portion of his assets to pakistan between november 1947 and september 1948. being of opinion however that not only this act of transfer which took place before the 18th day of october, 1949, but other circumstances including the appellant 's conduct after october 18, 1949, have to be, taken into consideration before action under

property who heard this petition in revision was unable to agree with the district judge 's findings on the question as regards the order under section 22(b) and accordingly made a reference under

his assets should relate to an act done by any person, after, he was declared as an intending evacuee. it further held that the fact that dr. mohammad saeed had during the period from august 14, 1947 to october 18, 1949, transferred a substantial portion of his assets in india to pakistan constituted under the law a preparation for his migration to pakistan and that this justified a declaration by

judge in respect of deputy custodian general 's orders under section 22(b) and directed the custodian general or the deputy custodian general, if authorised to deal with it, to dispose of the

so that any property of such a person is evacuee property within the meaning of the act. when in respect of property of such a person an order has been made under section 7 of the act declaring it to be evacuee property the evacuee or his heir will be entitled to make 376 an application for restoration of the property under section 16 of the act, and after due inquiry the central government may, subject to the conditions specified in the section make an order restoring the property to the applicant. another benefit which a person who is an evacuee within the meaning of section 2(d)(iv) is entitled to, along with other evacuees, is that of section 13 of the displaced persons (compensation and rehabilitation) act (xliv of 1954), under which when any property of an evacuee has been acquired under section 12 there shall be paid to an evacuee compensation in respect of his property. . . . in accordance with such principles and in such manner as may be agreed upon between the governments of india and pakistan. take however the case of a person, like the present petitioner who after the 14th day of august, 1947, and before the 18th day of october, 1949, transferred his assets or any portion thereof to pakistan. he would be an \"intending evacuee\" within the meaning of section 2(e)(i) of the act and once a declaration had been made under section 19 that he was an intending evacuee his property would be liable to be declared evacuee property under section 22(b). even so however he would not get the benefit of section 16 of act xxxi of 1950 or of section 13 of the . the result of the several provisions of law of the , after it was amended in 1953 therefore is that if a person transferred his assets or any part of his assets to pakistan without the previous approval of the custodian after the 18th day of october, 1949, he would be an evacuee in law and his property will be liable to be declared an evacuee property, but he will still be entitled to restoration of the property under section 16 of the , and also to the benefit of section 13 of the (xliv of 1954); but if a person transferred his assets or part of his assets to pakistan between the 14th day of august, 1947, and the 18th day of october, 1949, he was liable 377 to be declared an intending evacuee at any date before the amended act of 1953 came into force and if that has happened, any property belonging to him was liable to be declared evacuee property under section 22 of the act at any time before chapter iv of that act was repealed by the 1953 act and even after that date if any proceeding under section 22 was pending on the ' date of the commencement of the 1953 act. but such a person would not be entitled to the benefit of either section 16 of the , or compensation under section 13 of the (xliv of 1954). this denial of benefits under section 16 of the 1950 act and section 13 of the 1954 act to one who has been declared an intending evacuee on the ground of transfer of assets to pakistan amounts, it is urged by the learned counsel, to be a denial of equal protection of laws and it is contended that section 22(b) of the as it stood before the section war, repealed along with other sec tions of chapter iv should be held to be void. in our judgment, this contention is not well founded. in the first place it is to be pointed out that a person who transferred assets between the 14th august, 1947, and the 18th october, 1949, and a person who transferred such assets after the 18th october, 1949, cannot properly be considered to be similarly circumstanced.", "completion": "learned counsel has pointed out that under section 2(d)(iv) of the , as it stood after its amendment by act 11 of 1953, a person who has after the 18th day of october, 1949, transferred to pakistan without the previous approval of the custodian his assets or any part of his assets situated in any part of the territories to which the act extends is an evacuee;

evacuee property ordinance, 1949, was made. persons who had transferred assets between the 14th august, 1947, and the 18th october, 1949, may therefore reasonably have been considered by the legislature to form a class distinct in respect of the application of the law to their property from those who transferred assets after the 18th october, 1949. we are not however concerned with the reasons or the wisdom of the policy which underlay the denial of the 378 benefits of section 16 of the and section 13 of the (xliv of 1954) to those persons who had been declared intending evacuees because of having transferred assets between the 14th august, 1947, and the 18th october, 1949, while granting these benefits to those who were evacuees under the law as amended in 1953, because of transfer of assets to pakistan after the 18th october, 1949. what is clear is that the two groups of persons are not similarly circumstanced and so the denial of equal benefits to the two groups is not an infringement of the guarantee of equal protection of laws. next it is important to note that this differenceviz., that one group of persons is entitled to the benefits of the sections mentioned above while another group is not does not flow directly or necessarily from section 22(b). what is characterised as discrimination between an evacuee and an intending evacuee is the consequence of the legislature 's omission to extend to the intending evacuees the benefits of section 16 of the 1950 act and section 13 of the 1954 act as mentioned above and not of the provisions under section 22(b) that under certain circumstances as specified therein the custodian may declare the property of an intending evacuee to be evacuee property. we do not think that it is possible to say therefore that section 22(b) of the contravenes article 14 of the constitution. the petition under article 32 of the constitution therefore fails and is dismissed with costs. the appeal raises the question of the effect of the application of section 22(b) of the act to the facts of the present case. section 22(b), substituting therein for the words \"he had done any of the acts specified in sub clauses (i) and (iii) of clause (e) of section 2\" the words of only cluse 2(e)(i), reads thus: \"if the custodian is satisfied, after such enquiry as may be prescribed, that the circumstances relating to any person,

part thereof situated in any part of the territories to which this act extends are such as may be prescribed as constituting a preparation for his migration to pakistan, the custodian may declare any property situated in the state in which such person has any right or interest to be evacuee property and on the issue of such notification any property specified in the notification shall be deemed to

dispute that this transfer was made before he was declared an intending evacuee. the first contention raised on behalf of the appellant was that this transfer having been made before the declaration

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: indeed the scheme of the legislation appears to be that the fact that any portion of a person 's assets has been transferred to pakistan is sufficient to make him liable to a declaration that he is an intending evacuee; but he becomes liable to the further declaration that his property is evacuee property, where it appears that what was transferred forms a substantial portion of his assets. in some cases it may happen that what was transferred before his declaration as an intending evacuee formed a small part of his assets. in such a case if later on other portions of his assets were transferred to pakistan and the two transfers together amount to a transfer of a substantial portion of his assets, his property will be liable to be declared as evacuee property: it will be difficult to find any logic in the argument that when what was transferred before his declaration as intending evacuee was itself a substantial portion of his assets, such liability should not fasten. quite apart however from the question of logic or reasonableness it is quite clear from the language used in the section that the legislature in. tended such circumstance of transfer of a substantial portion of assets to be available for consideration for the purpose of an order under section 22(b) whether or not the transfer took place before the person was declared as an intending evacuee or afterwards. it was next urged that in any case it would be proper for the custodian to take other circumstances including the later conduct of the intending evacuee to decide whether or not he should declare his property to be evacuee property. it is unnecessary for 381 us to consider whether it is open to the custodian to consider such other circumstances. the section however gives a custodian the authority to declare the property of a person who has been declared an intending evacuee to be evacuee property whenever the existence of any of the circumstances prescribed as constituting a preparation for his migrating to pakistan is established. where, as in the present case, a custodian in exercise of such authority has given such a declaration there is no reason for saying that the declaration has been improperly made. in our opinion, the high court was right in setting aside the order of the district judge and in directing the custodian general or the deputy custodian general to dispose of the matter in accordance with the views expressed by the high court that on the facts proved in the case the order made by the deputy custodian declaring dr. mohammad saeed 's property as evacuee property was right. the order made by the deputy custodian general in compliance with the directions given by the high court cannot therefore be assailed. the appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs. appeal dismissed.", "completion": "in such a case if later on other portions of his assets were transferred to pakistan and the two transfers together amount to a transfer of a substantial portion of his assets, his property will be liable to be declared as evacuee property: it will be difficult to find any logic in the argument that when what was transferred before his declaration as intending evacuee was itself a substantial portion of his assets, such liability should not fasten.\nthe section however gives a custodian the authority to declare the property of a person who has been declared an intending evacuee to be evacuee property whenever the existence of any of the circumstances prescribed as constituting a preparation for his migrating to pakistan is established."}

(od*)\" (*which perhaps are meant to indicate that the onus was on the defendant in respect of this issue). it appears that the defendant led evidence first, in view of the fact that the onus lay on him. he was examined as d.w.5, and in his examination in chief he 336 stated, \"i did not receive any gold towards, these hundis i asked them to return the hundis, but 'they did not return them. , i had ' drawn the two hundis marked exhibit p.

court lost sight of the fact that in 1947 a new stamp act had come into force in the former state of marwar, amending the marwar stamp act of 1914. the \"new law was, in terms, similar to the indian

advantage of the provisions of that section because, in its opinion, the admission of the two hundis 'was a pure mistake '. relying upon a previous decision of the rajasthan high court in ratan lal vs dan das (1), the high court held that as the admission of the documents was pure mistake, the high court, on appeal, could go behind the orders of the trial court and correct the mistake made by that court. in our opinion, the high court misdirected itself, in its view of the provisions of section 36 of the stamp act. section 36 is in these terms: \"where an instrument has been admitted in evidence, such admission shall not, except as provided in section 61, be called in question at any stage of the same suit or proceeding on the ground that the instrument has not been duly stamped. \" that section is categorical in its terms that when a document has once been admitted in evidence, such admission cannot be called in question at any stage of the suit or the proceeding on the ground that the instrument had not been duly stamped. the only exception recognised by the section is the class of cases contemplated by section 61, which is not material to the present controversy. section 36 does not admit of other exceptions. where a question as to the admissibility of a document is raised on the ground that it has not been stamped, or has not been properly stamped, it has to be decided then and there when the (1) i.l.r. 338 document is tendered in evidence. once the court, rightly or wrongly, decides to admit the document in evidence, so far as the parties are concerned, the matter is closed. section 35 is in the nature of a penal provision and has far reaching effects. parties to a litigation, where such a controversy is raised, have to be circumspect and the party challenging the admissibility of the document has to be alert to see that the document is not admitted in evidence by the court. the court has to judicially determine the matter as soon as the document is tendered in evidence and before it is marked as an exhibit in the case. the record in this case discloses the fact that the hundis were marked as exs. p. 1 and p. 2 and bore the endorsement 'admitted in evidence ' under the signature of the court. it is not, therefore, one of those cases where a document has been inadvertently admitted, without the court applying its mind to the question of its admissibility. once a document has been marked as an exhibit in the case and the trial has proceeded all along on the footing that the document was an exhibit in the case and has been used by the parties in examination and cross examination of their witnesses, section 36 of the stamp act comes into operation. once a document has been admitted in evidence, as aforesaid, it is not open either to the trial court itself or to a court of appeal or revision to go behind that order. such an order is not one of those judicial orders which are liable to be reviewed or revised by the same court or a court of superior jurisdiction. in our opinion, the high court has erred in law in refusing to act upon those two hundis which had been properly proved if they required any proof, their execution having been admitted by the executant himself. as on the finding,% no other question arises, nor was any other question raised before us by the parties, we accordingly allow the

and that is how the matter has come up before us. the only ground on which the nomination paper was rejected by the returning officer was that the proposer had nominated the candidate for election from bihar and not dhanbad assembly constituency. the nomination was made on a hindi form printed for the purpose by the government. unfortunately, the printed form did not exactly conform to the hindi printed form in the rules framed under the representation of the people act, no. lxiii of 1951, (hereinafter called the act). the heading in the specimen printed form in the rules requires the name of the state in which the election is held, to be filled in the blank space there; but in the printed form supplied to the respondent the name of the state was already printed in the heading and therefore the blank space had to be filled in with the name of the constituency. the candidate therefore filled in the name of the constituency in the blank space in the heading. thereafter the proposer filled in the next part of the form which has five columns, after the main part which says that the proposer nominates so and so for such and such constituency. in this main part, the name of the candidate and the name of the constituency 404 have to be filled in by the proposer. in the particular form with which we are concerned now the name of the candidate was rightly filled in but the proposer instead of putting down the name of the constituency, namely dhanbad, put down the name bihar there. so the proposal read as if the candidate was being nominated for the bihar assembly constituency. the only objection taken before the returning officer was that the proposer had not mentioned the constituency for which he was proposing the candidate for election and therefore the nomination 'form was defective and should be rejected. this found favour with the return ing officer, who rejected the nomination paper as already said, on the ground that the proposer had nominated the candidate for election for bihar assembly constituency and not dhanbad assembly constituency. it may be mentioned that it is no one 's case that there is any constituency like bihar assembly constituency. it may also be mentioned that this. was a bye election and not a general election; and the question whether the nomination paper was rightly rejected will have to be considered in this background. now section 33(1) of the act requires that a nomination paper completed in the prescribed form and signed by the candidate and by an elector of the constituency as proposer shall be filed on or before the date appointed for the nomination. section 33(4) lays down that on the presentation of a nomination paper, the returning officer shall satisfy himself that the names and electoral roll numbers of the candidate and his proposer as entered in the nomination paper are the same as those entered in the electoral rolls; provided that the returning officer shall permit any clerical or technical error in the nomination paper in regard to the said names or numbers to be corrected in order to bring them into conformity with the corresponding entries in the electoral roll; and where necessary, direct that any clerical or printing error in the said entries shall be overlooked.", "completion": "in the present appeal we are only concerned with one of the grounds that the nomination paper of the respondent was improperly rejected.\nthe election tribunal held that the nomination paper was rightly rejected and thereafter dismissed the petition.\nthe respondent went in appeal to the high court, and the main point pressed in appeal was that the election tribunal was wrong in holding that the nomination paper of the respondent was rightly rejected.\nthe high court agreed with the contention of the respondent that his nomination paper was improperly rejected and therefore allowed the appeal and set aside the election of the appellant.\nthe only ground on which the nomination paper was rejected by the returning officer was that the proposer had nominated the candidate for election from bihar and not dhanbad assembly constituency.\nthe only objection taken before the returning officer was that the proposer had not mentioned the constituency for which he was proposing the candidate for election and therefore the nomination 'form was defective and should be rejected.\nthis found favour with the return ing officer, who rejected the nomination paper as already said, on the ground that the proposer had nominated the candidate for election for bihar assembly constituency and not dhanbad assembly constituency.\nnow section 33(1) of the act requires that a nomination paper completed in the prescribed form and signed by the candidate and by an elector of the constituency as proposer shall be filed on or before the date appointed for the nomination."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: section 36 then prescribes for the scrutiny of nomination papers and sub section (2) (b) thereof lays down that the nomination paper shall be rejected if there has been a failure to comply with any 405 of the provisions of section 33. but sub section (4) lays down that the returning officer shall not reject any nomination paper on the ground of any defect which is not of a substantial character. the result of these provisions is that the proposer and the candidate are expected to file the nomination papers complete in all respects in accordance with the prescribed form; but even if there is some defect in the nomination paper in regard to either the names or the electoral roll numbers, it is the duty of the returning officer to satisfy himself at the time of the presentation of the nomination paper about them and if necessary to allow them to be corrected, in order to bring them into conformity with the corresponding entries in the electoral roll. thereafter on scrutiny the returning officer has the power to reject the nomination paper on the ground of failure to comply with any of the provisions of section 33 subject however to this that no nomination paper shall be rejected on the ground of any defect which is not of a substantial character. the main dispute in the high court centered on the question whether the defect in this case on the ground of which the returning officer rejected the nomination paper was of a substantial character or not. generally speaking if the nomination paper does not disclose at all the name of the constituency for which the nomination has been made, the defect would be of a substantial character, for there would then be no way of knowing the constituency for which a candidate is being nominated. but there may be cases where the nomination form shows the constituency for which the nomination is being made though there may be some defect in filling up the form. in such a case it seems to us that if the nomination form discloses the constituency for which the nomination is being made even though the form may not have been properly filled in that respect, the defect in filling the form would not be of a substantial character. it is true that in this case there was a defect in filling up the blank by the proposer inasmuch as he wrote the word \"bihar\" before the words \"assembly constituency\" instead of 52 406 the word \"dhanbad\", which he should have done; and if there were nothing else in the form to disclose the constituency for which the nomination was being made there would have been a substantial defect in the nomination form which would justify the returning officer in rejecting the same. but the circumstances of the present case are rather peculiar. we have already mentioned that the printed hindi form which was used in this case printed the heading wrongly inasmuch as the heading was not in accordance with the heading prescribed under the rules. in the specimen form in the rules, the blank space is meant for the state in which the election is being held; but because of the mistake in printing the heading in this case, the blank space could only be filled up with the name of the constituency, and that was what was done. this name was filled in apparently by the candidate himself and not by the proposer. but equally clearly the name of the constituency was there when the proposer in his turn came to fill up that part of the form which he had to fill. it seems that the proposer was thus misled, as the name of the constituency was already there in the heading, to write the word \"bihar\" in the second blank space in his proposal instead of the word \"dhanbad\" to indicate the constituency. that was undoubtedly a defect in the form as filled in by the proposer. the question however is whether in these circumstances it can be called a defect of a substantial character which would justify the rejection of the nomination paper. it seems to us that the defect appeared partly because of the mistake in the printing of the hindi form which was supplied to the candidates for the purposes of the nomination to this bye election. the form however as put in clearly shows in the heading the particular assembly constituency for which the election was being held. then follows the part which has to be filled in by the proposer and there the proposer made a mistake in filling the word \"bihar\" instead of the word \"dhanbad\" in the blank space relating to the constituency. considering however that the name of the constituency was already there in the heading, it would in our 407 opinion be not improper in the circumstances of this case to say that the proposer was nominating the candidate for the constituency which was already mentioned in the heading. it seems to us therefore that in view of the mistake that occurred in the printing of the form and in view of the fact that the name of the constituency for which the election was being held was already in the heading, the mistake of the proposer in putting in the word \"bihar\" instead of the \"dhanbad\", which resulted in a defect in the filling up of the form was not of a substantial character and that it was quite clear on the form in this case that the nomination was for the dhanbad assembly constituency.", "completion": "but there may be cases where the nomination form shows the constituency for which the nomination is being made though there may be some defect in filling up the form.\nin such a case it seems to us that if the nomination form discloses the constituency for which the nomination is being made even though the form may not have been properly filled in that respect, the defect in filling the form would not be of a substantial character.\nit is true that in this case there was a defect in filling up the blank by the proposer inasmuch as he wrote the word \"bihar\" before the words \"assembly constituency\" instead of 52 406 the word \"dhanbad\", which he should have done;

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: the returning officer does not seem to have attached any importance to the name of the constituency in the heading in this case and also seems to have ignored the fact that this was a bye election to one constituency, when he came to consider the defect which undoubtedly was there in this respect in the nomination paper. we therefore agree with the high court that in the peculiar circumstances created by the mistake in printing the hindi nomination form by the government, the defect which has occurred in this case is not of a substantial character and it was quite clear that the nomination paper was for the dhanbad assembly constituency and was in consequence improperly rejected by the returning officer. as we have already said, this was the only ground on which the nomination paper was challenged as defective before the returning officer; but before the election tribunal the appellant also contended that the nomination paper was defective as columns 2 and 5 of the part which has to be filled in by the proposer were not properly filled in and were defective; and it was urged that the defect there was substantial and therefore even if the reason for the rejection of the nomination paper as given by the returning officer was not substantial, these defects were substantial and the rejection should be upheld on the ground of these defects. column 2 requires the electoral roll number of the proposer and column 5 of the candidate to be 408 filled in there. further according to the directions given in the form columns 2 and 5 should contain the name of the constituency, the part of the electoral roll and the serial number in that part. the purpose of this provision is that the returning officer should be able readily to check that the proposer and the candidate are voters on the electoral roll. in the present case only the serial number and the house number are mentioned in columns 2 and 5 and not the name of the constituency and the number of the part. undoubtedly therefore there was a defect in these two columns. apparently the constituency was the same, viz., dhanbad, as will appear from the address given in column 4. no part number could be given as the electoral roll in this particular case was not numbered by parts. the question is whether in these circumstances this defect can be called a defect of a substantial character. in this connection we cannot ignore the provisions of section 33(4) of the act, which casts a duty on the returning officer to satisfy himself that the names and electoral roll numbers of the candidate and his proposer as entered in the nomination paper are the same as those entered in the electoral roll and gives him the power to permit the removal of any defect in this connection. the returning officer does not seem to have noted this defect in the form for if he had done so he would have given an opportunity to the proposer to make the corrections. it is true that the failure of the returning officer to give this opportunity for correction does not mean that the defect can be ignored, if it is of a substantial character. but considering the purpose for which the electoral roll numbers are given, it seems that the returning officer found no difficulty in checking that the proposer as well as the candidate was a voter on the electoral rolls. the high court in this connection referred to the evidence of the respondent who stated that when his nomination paper was taken up for scrutiny, the returning officer compared the names in the nomination paper with those in the electoral rolls. it seems therefore that in this case the returning officer found no difficulty in tracing the names of the proposer and the candidate 409 in the electoral rolls and that is why no objection was raised before him as to the defect in columns 2 and 5. in the circumstances it must be hold that the defect was of an unsubstantial character and would not result in the rejection of the nomination paper. we may in this connection refer to karnail singh vs election tribunal, hissar and other8 (1), where this court observed that it was quite clear on the evidence that there was no difficulty in identifying the candidate and the candidate himself pointed out to the returning officer his own name in the electoral rolls. therefore the defect in columns 2 and 5 was in the circumstances held to be a technical one and not of a substantial character. the principle of that case in our opinion applies to the present case also, for there is no doubt here that the returning officer found no difficulty in identifying the proposer as well as the candidate and as a matter of fact the evidence is that the candidate himself pointed out the place in the electoral rolls where his name was entered. we therefore agree with the high court that in the circumstances of this case the defects in columns 2 and 5 were of an unsubstantial character and the rejection of the nomination paper cannot be upheld on this further ground, which was not even urged before the returning officer. we therefore dismiss the appeal. in these circumstances we pass no order as to costs. appeal dismissed.", "completion": "we therefore agree with the high court that in the peculiar circumstances created by the mistake in printing the hindi nomination form by the government, the defect which has occurred in this case is not of a substantial character and it was quite clear that the nomination paper was for the dhanbad assembly constituency and was in consequence improperly rejected by the returning officer.\nas we have already said, this was the only ground on which the nomination paper was challenged as defective before the returning officer;

(1), the expression \"tenant\" was defined, in so far as the definition is material, as meaning any person by whom or on whose account rent was payable for a building or rented land and included a tenant continuing in possession after the termination of the tenancy in his favour, but did not include a person placed in occupation of a building or rented land by its tenant, unless with the consent of the landlord. by section 13, the right of the landlord to evict a tenant even in execution of a decree was restricted and the landlord could seek to evict his tenant by an application to the controller in certain specified circumstances set out in that section. on august 30, 1954, the company addressed a letter to the appellant intimating that it desired to close down its office in gurgaon with effect from september 1, 1954. the relevant part of the letter ran as follows: 19 \"now the company has closed its agency busi ness at gurgaon and mr. khosla will be carrying on sewing machine business in gurgaon in your shop in his personal capacity and not as a manager of singer company. in order that there may not be any misunderstanding about the payment of rent in future, you are informed that from september, 1954 onwards mr. khosla will be personally responsible for the payment of rent of your shop. \" the appellant informed the company that unless vacant possession was delivered to him tenancy could not be validly determined, and that the company will be held responsible till such delivery for liability to pay rent and that in the event of possession being transferred to any other person, legal action will be taken against the company. but the company delivered possession of the shop to khosla and allowed him to occupy the shop in his personal capacity from september 1, 1954. thereafter, on october 31, 1954, the appellant applied under section 13 of the act to the controller for an order against khosla and the company on three grounds, (1) that the company did not require the premises any longer while the appellant required the same for his own use, (2) that the company had neglected to pay rent since september 1, 1954, and (3) that the company had assigned or sublet the shop to khosla without the written consent of the appellant. khosla and the company resisted the application contending that khosla was the tenant of the appellant and that in any event, on august 28, 1954, the company through its local supervisor had delivered possession of the shop to the appellant and that the latter agreed to treat khosla as his tenant with effect from september 1, 1954. the controller rejected the pleas raised by khosla and the company and ordered that possession be delivered by the com pany to the appellant. in appeal to the district court at rohtak, the order passed by the controller was confirmed. in a petition under article 227 of the constitution filed by khosla in the high court of judicature for. punjab at chandigarh, the order passed by the district court was quashed. the high court was of the view that after august 31, 1954, the 20 company had no interest left in the tenancy and the tenancy being from month to month terminable at the will of the appellant, such tenancy could not be the subject matter of transfer or of sub letting. the high court therefore held that the order passed was without jurisdiction. in the course of the judgment, the high court observed that full rent had been paid even after september 1, 1954, and therefore the ground of non payment of rent \"was not open to\" the appellant. it is accepted at the bar that in making this observation, the high court was under a mis apprehension. the rent accruing due was not paid to the appellant, but was deposited in court. against the order passed by the high court, this appeal is preferred with special leave. the controller and the district court found that the tenant of the shop in dispute was not khosla but the company. these two tribunals also found that possession of the shop was handed over by the company to khosla without the consent of the appellant. these findings were binding upon the high court. the only question which fell to be determined by the high court was whether by unilateral action on its part, the company could require the appellant to treat khosla as his tenant.", "completion": "the singer sewing machine

(b) of the bihar land reforms act, 1950, by adding the word \"mela\" after the words \"jalkars, hats, and bazars\" and by omitting the words \"subject to the subsequent provisions of this chapter\" in cl. (a) of section 4. it also amended section 6 of the 1950 act by substituting for the words \"notwithstanding anything contained in this act\" the words \"subject to the provisions of sections 7a and 7b\". of these section 7b provides that \"where on any land deemed to be settled with the intermediary under the provisions of section 5, section 6 or section 7, a mela was being held by the intermediary at any time within 3 years of the date of vesting, the right to hold such mela on such land shall, with effect from such date, vest in the state and notwithstanding anything contained in any law, the state shall have and the intermediary shall not, except with the consent of the state government have the right to hold such mela on such land or to do anything which may prejudicially affect such mela\". section 7c contains provisions as regards settlement of hats, bazars or melas referred to in section 7a and section 7b and provides inter alia that settlements will be made with the outgoing intermediary or his heir after application is received from him and if there are several of them who apply for settlement, with the most suitable of them. the amending act made the amendments mentioned above, except the insertion of a. 7c, retrospective, with effect from the date of enactment of the parent act.", "completion": "r. c.\njha, section k.\nk. sinha, for the respondents.\nk. garg and section c.\ngarg and section c.\nk. garg and section c.\nxvi of 1959 (bihar land reforms amendment act, 1959), in so far as it amends with retrospective effect sections 4 and 6 of the bihar land reforms act, 1950, to be indicated later, and inserts the new sections, section 7b and section 7c in that act.\nit appears that sometime after the bihar land reforms act became law and action was taken under section 3 thereof by the state government issuing notifications, declaring that the estates or tenures of proprietors or tenure holders, specified in the noti fications had passed to and become vested in the state, the revenue authorities started interfering with the rights of those ex proprietors and ex tenureholders to hold melas on lands of which they were thereafter in occupation as occupancy raiyats under the state and started settling rights to realise tolls from such melas on behalf of the state government.\n351 of 1959, c.\n27 of 1960, c.\n92 of 1960, c.\n285 of 1960 and c.\nthe high court held that in view of the provisions of section 6 of the bihar land reforms act (before its amendment) and the fact that the provisions made in section 4(a) of the act about the consequences that would ensue on the vesting of an estate or tenure in the state were \"subject to\" the provisions of section 6, the state had no right to hold melas on the bakasht lands of the ex intermediaries now occupancy raiyats."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: the amending act had already been passed, when several other applications under article 226 of the constitution for similar relief against the interference by the government with the intermediaries ' right to hold melas came up for consideration before the high court. the high court rejected these applicants ' attack against the validity of the amending act and held that in view of the provisions 386 now made the applicants were not entitled to any relief. civil appeal no. 574 of 1960 has been preferred by one of such applicants on a certificate granted by the high court. the two applications under article 32 of the constitution were filed in this court for writs of mandamus against the state of bihar and its officers restraining them from interfering with the applicant 's right to hold melas on their lands. both of these were filed after the bihar land reforms amendment act, 1959, had become law. it is obvious that if the amending act is valid legislation, in so far as it amends with retrospective effect section 4 and section 6 of the 1950 act as mentioned above and inserts section 7b, the ex intermediaries have not and the state has the right to hold melas on the bakasht lands. the main question therefore is whether this is a valid legislation. to answer this question we have to examine in the first place whether the bihar legislature which enacted the amending act had on that date the legislative competence under article 246 of the constitution to do so; and secondly, whether the law was void because of the provisions of article 13 of the constitution. the amending legislation was clearly within item 42 of the concurrent list, being a law as regards acquisition of property. mr. tarkeshwar dayal, who appeared on behalf of one of the ex intermediaries submitted that this was really not a matter of land reform; the purpose of the amending legislation being only to augment the revenue of the state. it is true that the law by taking the right to hold melas from certain persons and giving it to the state is likely to augment the revenues of the state. it may well be that this object of augmenting the revenues was one of the main purposes behind the amending legislation. that however is no reason to think that this legislation is not also concerned with land reform. it is however unnecessary for us to consider this question further, for whether it is a law as regards land reform or not, it is clearly and entirely as regards acquisition of property. the question of the legislature having attempted legislation not within 387, its competence by putting it into the guise of legislation within its competence does not even arise. the conclusion that necessarily follows is that the amending legislation was within the legislative competence of the bihar legislature under article 246 of the constitution. this brings us to the main question in controversy, viz., whether the amending legislation is void on the ground that it violates articles 31, 19 and 14 of the constitution. a complete answer to this question is furnished in favour of the state if this is a law within the saving provisions of article 31a. article 31a was enacted in the constitution by the constitution (first amendment act) with retrospective effect from the commencement of the constitution. it was further amended by the constitution (fourth amendment) act, also with retrospective effect from the date of the commencement of the constitution. this article provides inter alia, that notwithstanding anything contained in article 13, no law providing for the acquisition by the state of any estate or of any rights therein. . . shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by articles 19, 31 and 14 of the constitution. is the amending legislation a law \"providing for the acquisition by the state of any estate or of any rights therein?\" two arguments have been advanced on behalf of the ex intermediaries to convince us that it is not such a law. the first argument is that what the amending legislation provides for is not \"acquisition\" at all within the meaning of article 31a as it is not \"acquisition\" for a public purpose. it has been urged that the purpose is a mere augmentation of revenue. it does not appear to us that when the right of holding the mela is taken over by the state the only purpose is the augmentation of revenue. there is scope for thinking that the legislature believed that melas would be better run and be more in the interests of the general public when run by the state than when they are left without control in the hands of private individuals with whom the profit motive is 388 likely to be the sole guiding principle. it is unnecessary however to answer this question for, in our opinion, a law, may be a law providing for \"acquisition\" even though the purpose behind the acquisition is not a public purpose. it is important to notice that the constitution (fourth amendment) act made important alterations in article 31 also. one of the amendments of article 31 was that clause 2 now provides that no property shall be compulsorily acquired, (1) save for a public purpose and (2) save by authority of a law which contains provisions for compensation for the property acquired and either fixes the amount of compensation or specifies the principles on which and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined and given.", "completion": "the amending act had already been passed, when several other applications under article 226 of the constitution for similar relief against the interference by the government with the intermediaries ' right to hold melas came up for consideration before the high court.\nit is obvious that if the amending act is valid legislation, in so far as it amends with retrospective effect section 4 and section 6 of the 1950 act as mentioned above and inserts section 7b, the ex intermediaries have not and the state has the right to hold melas on the bakasht lands.\nto answer this question we have to examine in the first place whether the bihar legislature which enacted the amending act had on that date the legislative competence under article 246 of the constitution to do so;

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: then, article 31 a provides inter alia that a law providing for \"acquisition\" will not be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges a right conferred by article 31. reading the two articles together as they stand after the fourth amendment of the constitution it becomes obvious that when article 31a speaks of a law of \"acquisition\" it contemplates a law which may be for acquisition, though not for a public purpose and lays down that even though this will be in violation of the fundamental right guaranteed by the first part of article 31(2) the law will not be void because of such violation. the question whether the validity of a law for compulsory acquisition of property by the state can be challenged on the ground that the \"acquisition\" is not for a public purpose bad to be considered by this court even before the amendment of article 31(2) as mentioned above in the state of bihar vs sir kameshwar singh (1). article 31(2) as it then stood did not in so many words provide that no acquisition can be made save for a public purpose; but it was argued on behalf of the state that such a provision was implicit in the words of article 31(2). this argument was rejected by mahajan and chandrasekhara aiyar, jj., but it was accepted by patanjali sastri, c. j., and das, j., both of whom held that the requirement of public (1) 389 purpose being a condition for compulsory acquisition laid down by article 31(2) the law was saved in spite of the violation of such condition by article 31(4) and also article 31a. mukherjea, j., also said that the requirement of public purpose was a condition implied in the provisions of article 31(2). his lordship then added: \"for my part, i would be prepared to assume that cl. (4) of article 31 relates to everything that is provided for in clause (2) either in express terms or impliedly and consequently the question of the existence of a public purpose does not come within the purview of an inquiry in the present case. \" it was in this state of judicial opinion that article 31(2) was amended by the constitution (fourth amendment) act as mentioned above and the requirement of public purpose was expressly made a condition for compulsory acquisition by the state. the basis for the argument that the question whether there was a public purpose or not is open to judicial review in spite of article 31a has therefore disappeared. it is worth noticing in this connection that in sir kameshwar singh 's case(1) the argument that quite apart from anything in article 31(2) as it then stood no law of acquisition could be made except for a public purpose was sought to be reinforced by the words in item 36 of the state list and item 42 of the concurrent list. these items read as follows: \"36. acquisition or requisitioning of property, except for the purposes of the union, subject to the provisions of entry 42 of list ill.\" \"42. principles on which compensation for property acquired or requisitioned for the purposes of the union or of a state or for any other public purpose is to be determined, and the form and the manner in which such compensation is to be given. \" the argument on the basis of these entries was that the state legislatures had no power to make a, law for acquisition of property without fulfilling ' the condition of public purpose. the constitution (.seventh amendment) act which came into force on the 1st (1) 50 390 day of november, 1956, deleted entry 36 of the state list and substituted for the former phraseology of item 42 of the concurrent list the words \"acquisition and requisition of property\". it is quite clear that after its amendment the legislative list permits the state legislature to enact a law of acquisition even without a public purpose; and that the only obstacle to such a law being enacted without a public purpose is the provisions of article 31(2). that obstacle also disappears if the law in question is one within article 31 a. it was next contended that the acquisition of the right to hold the mela, for which the amending act provides is not acquisition, in any case, of \"rights\" \"in any estate\" within the meaning of article 31a as defined in cl. 2(b) of the same article. it was argued that this definition includes only rights of persons who are intermediaries and unless the raiyat whose rights are being acquired is an intermediary, that is, a person between the state and the tiller of the soil, his rights are not rights within the definition of \"rights in relation to an estate\"; and consequently, a law providing for acquisition of the rights of such a raiyat is not a law within the saving provisions of article 31a. it is pointed out that on the date the amending act was passed the ex intermediaries had ceased to exist as intermediaries and had become occupancy raiyats under section 6 of the parent act. what were being acquired therefore, it is argued, were not rights of intermediaries but rights of raiyats who had ceased to be intermediaries. it has to be noticed that the impugned provisions amending section 4 and section 6 and section 7(b) have been given retrospective effect so that the parent act of 1950 has to be read as containing on the very date of its enactment provisions in these sections not as originally enacted but as they stood after the amendment of 1959.", "completion": "the question whether the validity of a law for compulsory acquisition of property by the state can be challenged on the ground that the \"acquisition\" is not for a public purpose bad to be considered by this court even before the amendment of article 31(2) as mentioned above in the state of bihar vs sir kameshwar singh (1).\narticle 31(2) as it then stood did not in so many words provide that no acquisition can be made save for a public purpose;

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: in deciding whether rights of raiyats were being acquired or not we have to forget what happened in consequence of the unmended section 6. projecting ourselves to the date september 25, 1950, when the president 's assent to the bihar land reforms act, 1950, was published in the 391 gazette and reading the act as containing section 4 and section 6 as amended and also section 7(b) it cannot but be held that what were being acquired by means of these provisions of the amending legislation giving retrospective effect were certain rights of the intermediaries. these intermediaries had not on september 25, 1950, ceased to be intermediaries and the fact that under the unmended provisions of section 6 they later on became occupancy raiyats should not be allowed to confuse the fact that the acquisition of certain properties by the amending legislation being itself with effect from september 25, 1950, what was being provided for was acquisition of intermediaries ' rights. even if it be assumed that what the amending legislation provided for was the acquisition of raiyats ' rights, there is no justification for holding that these rights were not \"rights in any estate\" within the definition of el. 2 of article 31a. clause 2(b) is in these words: \"the expression 'rights ' in relation to an estate, shall include any rights vesting in a proprietor, sub proprietor, under proprietor, tenure holder, ralyat, under raiyat or other intermediary and any rights or privileges in respect of land revenue. \" the contention on behalf of the ex intermediaries is that the rights of raiyats who are not intermediaries, in the sense of being middlemen between the state and the tiller of the soil, are not within this definition. this contention does not however stand a moment 's scrutiny, for the simple reason, that it is well known that ordinarily at least, a raiyat or an under raiyat is not a person, who can be called an intermediary. it is reasonable to think that the word \"raiyat\"was used in its ordinary well accepted sense, of the person \"who holds the land under the proprietor or a tenure holder \"for the purpose of cultivation\" and the word \"under raiyat\" used in the equally well accepted and ordinary sense of \"a person who holds land under a raiyat for the purpose of cultivation. \" it is necessary to remember in this 392 connection that article 31a as first enacted by the con stitution (first amendment) act did not contain these words \"raivat, under raiyat\"; and that after the first amendment the definition ran thus: \"the expression rights ', in relation to an estate shall include any rights vesting in a proprietor, sub proprietor, under proprietor,, tenure holder or other intermediary and any rights or privileges in respect of land revenue. \" it was the fourth amendment which in the year 1956 inserted the words \"raiyat, under raiyat \"immediately after the words \"tenure holder\". at that time laws bad already been passed in most of the states for the acquisition of the rights of intermediaries in the estates; rights of raiyats or under raiyats who might answer the description \"intermediary\" were also within the definition because of the use of the word \"or other intermediary\". the only reason for specifically including the rights of \"raiyats\" and \"under raiyats\" in the definition could therefore be to extend the protection of article 31a to laws providing for acquisition by the state governments of rights of these \"raiyats\" or \"under raiyats\". in the circumstances and in the particular setting in which the words \"raiyat\" or \"under raiyat\" were introduced into the definition, it must be held that the words \"or other intermediary\" occurring at the end, do not qualify or colour the meaning to be attached to the tenures newly added. another contention raised in support of the argument that the impugned law is not for acquisition of a right in an estate is that the right to hold a mela is not a right in the lands at all. this contention is wholly unsound. holding a hat, or bazar or mela is only a mode of user by the owner of his land. just as he can enjoy the land belonging to him in other ways, he can use it for the purpose of having a concourse of people buyers and sellers and others for a hat, or bazar or mela subject, as in the case of other user to the requirement that no nuisance is created and the legal right of others are not infringed. consequently, the right to hold a mela has always been 393 considered in this country to be an interest in land, an interest which the owner of the land can transfer to another along with the land or without the land. there can be no doubt therefore that the right of the proprietor of an estate to hold a mela on his own land is a right in the \"estate, being appurtenant to his ownership of the land; so also the right of a tenureholder, who it has to be remembered is the owner of the land subject only to the payment of rent to the proprietor, to hold a mela on land forming part of the tenure. it is true that a licence to hold a mela on another 's land in which no interest is transferred is not an interest in land; but there is no question here of the acquisition of any licence to hold a mela at another person 's land.", "completion": "even if it be assumed that what the amending legislation provided for was the acquisition of raiyats ' rights, there is no justification for holding that these rights were not \"rights in any estate\" within the definition of el.\nclause 2(b) is in these words: \"the expression 'rights ' in relation to an estate, shall include any rights vesting in a proprietor, sub proprietor, under proprietor, tenure holder, ralyat, under raiyat or other intermediary and any rights or privileges in respect of land revenue.\n\" it is necessary to remember in this 392 connection that article 31a as first enacted by the con stitution (first amendment) act did not contain these words \"raivat, under raiyat\";

articles of association of the company invests the 44 342 directors of the company with absolute discretion to refuse to register any transfer of shares. that article is in the following terms: \"the directors may in their absolute discretion and without giving any reason refuse to register any transfer of any shares whether such shares be fully paid or not. if the directors refuse to register the transfer of any shares, they shall within two months, after the date on which the transfer was lodged with the company, send to the transferees and the transferor notice of the refusal. \" one banarasi prasad jhunjhunwala is the holder of a block of 9500 fully paid up shares of the company. in january, 1953, he executed transfers in respect of 2500 out of those shares in favour of his son shyam sunder and in respect of 2100 shares in favour of his daughter in law savitadevi and lodged the transfers with the company for registration of the shares in the names of the transferees. the directors of the company by resolution dated august 1, 1953, in purported exercise of the powers under article 47b of the articles of association, declined to register the shares in the names of the transferees. petitions were then filed by banarasi prasad and the transferees in the high court of judicature at bombay for orders under section 38 of the indian companies act, 1913 for rectification of the register of the company maintaining that the refusal by the board of directors to register the transfer of the shares was \"mala fide, arbitrary and capricious\" and that the directors had acted with improper and ulterior motives. the high court rejected these petitions holding that in summary proceedings under section 38, controversial questions of law and fact could not be tried and that the proper remedy of the transferees, if so advised, was to file suits for relief in the civil court. requests were again made by the transferees to the company by letters dated february 29, 1956 to register the transfers made by banarasi prasad in 1953. the directors of the company in their meeting of march 15, 1956 reiterated their earlier resolution not to register the shares trans ferred in the names of the transferees. against this 343 action of the company, appeals were preferred to the central government under section 111 el.(3) of the indian , which had since been brought into operation on april 1, 1956. k. r. p. ayyangar, joint secretary, ministry of finance, who heard the appeals declined to order registration of transfers, because in his view, the questions raised in the appeals could, as suggested by the high court of bombay, be decided only in a civil suit. thereafter, banarasi prasad transferred a block of 100 shares to his son shyam sunder and another block of 100 shares to his daughter in law savitadevi, and the transferees requested the company by letters dated november 21, 1956, to register the transfers. in the meeting dated january 12, 1957, the directors of the company resolved not to register the transfers and informed the transferees accordingly. against this resolution, separate appeals were preferred by shyam sunder and savitadevi under section 111 el.(3) of the indian to the central government. it was submitted in para 4 of the petitions of appeal that the refusal to register the transfer of shares was without \"any reason, arbitrary and untenable\". the company filed representations submitting that the refusal was bona fide and was not \"without any reason, arbitrary and untenable\" as alleged. shyam sunder and savitadevi filed rejoinders to the representations submitting that they had never alleged that refusal to transfer the shares \"was capricious or mala fide\" and that all they had alleged was that the \"refusal was without any reason, arbitrary and untenable\". by separate orders dated may 29, 1957, the deputy secretary to the government of india, ministry of finance set aside the resolution passed by the board of directors in exercise of the powers conferred by sub sections(5) and (6) of section ill of the indian , and directed that the company do register the transfers. in so directing, the deputy secretary gave no reasons. against the orders passed by the deputy secretary, with special leave under article 136 of the constitution, these two appeals are preferred by the company. two questions fall to be determined in these appeals, (1) whether the central government exercising appellate powers under section 111 of the before its amendment by act 65 of 1960 is a tribunal exercising judicial functions and is subject to the appellate jurisdiction of this court under article 136 of the constitution, and (2) whether the central government acted in excess of its jurisdiction or otherwise acted illegally in directing the company to register the transfer of shares in favour of shyam sunder and savitadevi.", "completion": "resolutions of government may be amenable to writs under articles 32 and 226 in appropriate cases, but may not be subject to a direct appeal under article 136 as the decisions of a tribunal.\nthe position, however, changes when government embarks upon curial functions, and proceeds to exercise judicial power and decide disputes.\nthe officer who decides, may even be anonymous; but the decision is one of a tribunal, whether expressed in his name or in the name of ' the central government.\nthe decision of government thus falls within the powers of this court under article 136.\nhe argues that since there are no legal standards for judging the correctness or otherwise of the order of the central government and the decision being purely discretionary, it is neither judicial nor quasi judicial but merely administrative, and that no appeal can arise from the nature of things.\nbut if it is said that wherever any shareholder has proposed to transfer his shares to some new member, the court has a right to say to the directors, 'we will presume that your motives are arbitrary and capricious, or that your conduct is corrupt, unless you choose to tell us what your reasons were, and submit those reasons to our decision ', it would appear to me entirely altering the whole constitution of the company as provided by the articles.\" that shows that the directors are presumed to have acted honestly in the interests of the company and a case has to be made out against them."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: for that purpose, a memorandum of appeal setting out the grounds has to be filed, and the company, on notice, is required to make representations, if any, and so also the other side, and both sides are allowed to tender evidence to support their representations. the central government by its order then directs that the shares be registered or need not be registered. the central government is also empowered to include in its orders, directions as to payment of costs or otherwise. the (1) ; (2) ; (3) 365 function of the central government is curial and not executive. there is provision for a hearing and a decision on evidence, and that is indubitably a curial function. now, in its functions government often reaches decisions, but all decisions of government cannot be regarded as those of a tribunal. resolutions of government may affect rights of parties, and yet, they may not be in the exercise of judicial power. resolutions of government may be amenable to writs under articles 32 and 226 in appropriate cases, but may not be subject to a direct appeal under article 136 as the decisions of a tribunal. the position, however, changes when government embarks upon curial functions, and proceeds to exercise judicial power and decide disputes. in these circumstances, it is legitimate to regard the officer who deals with the matter and even government itself as a tribunal. the officer who decides, may even be anonymous; but the decision is one of a tribunal, whether expressed in his name or in the name of ' the central government. the word \"tribunal\" is a word of wide import, and the words \"court\" and \"tribunal\" embrace within them the exercise of judicial power in all its forms. the decision of government thus falls within the powers of this court under article 136. it is next argued by the learned attorney general that there is no law to interpret or to apply in these cases. he argues that since there are no legal standards for judging the correctness or otherwise of the order of the central government and the decision being purely discretionary, it is neither judicial nor quasi judicial but merely administrative, and that no appeal can arise from the nature of things. such a line was taken before the committee on ministers ' powers by lord hewart, and the argument reminds one of what he then said that such decisions are purely discretionary and the exercise of such arbitrary power is \"neither law nor justice or at all\". sir maurice gwyer also was of the opinion that an appeal could not be taken to court against a minister 's 47 366 decision even on the ground of miscarriage of justice, because that, in his opinion, was \"putting a duty on the court\" which was \"not the concern of the court\". this argument takes me to the heart of the controversy, and before i give my decision, i wish to say a few preliminary things. article 47 b gives to the directors a right to refuse to register shares in their absolute discretion, without giving reasons. in in re gresham life assurance society, ex parte penney james, l.j. observed: \"no doubt the directors are in a fiduciary position both towards the company and towards every shareholder in it. it is very easy to conceive cases such as those cases to which we have been referred, in which this court would interfere with any violation of the fiduciary duty so reposed in the directors. but in order to interfere upon that ground it must be made out that the directors have been acting from some improper motive, or arbitrarily and capriciously. that must be alleged and proved, and the person who has a right to allege and prove it is the shareholder who seeks to be removed from the list of shareholders and to substitute another person for himself. but if it is said that wherever any shareholder has proposed to transfer his shares to some new member, the court has a right to say to the directors, 'we will presume that your motives are arbitrary and capricious, or that your conduct is corrupt, unless you choose to tell us what your reasons were, and submit those reasons to our decision ', it would appear to me entirely altering the whole constitution of the company as provided by the articles.\" that shows that the directors are presumed to have acted honestly in the interests of the company and a case has to be made out against them. i shall only quote from another case, which summarises the position very aptly. in in re hannan 's king (browning) gold mining company (limited) (2), lindley, m.r. is reported to have decided the case thus: \"their lordships did not sit there as a court of (1) (1872) law rep. 8 ch.(2) , 367 honour; the question was whether the applicants had made out that the transferee was being improperly kept off the register. there was no evidence of that . the court ought, as a matter of honesty between man to man., to presume that the directors were acting within their powers unless the contrary was proved; but that was not proved by casting unfounded aspersions upon them.\" thus, the matter comes to this that the directors have a presumption in their favour and the opposite party must prove that there was want of good faith. the right of appeal which is given under the , allows the central government to judge this issue. for that purpose, parties are required, if they desire, to make representations and to put in evidence.", "completion": "a decision of a tribunal on a dispute inter partes, in the light of pleadings and evidence, is essentially a judicial one, and this court ought to be able, on the same material, to decide in an appeal whether the decision given was correct.\n10 of 1858, section 5, disputes concerning lands yet ungranted by the crown are referred to the supreme court, whose decision is to be final; and by section 8 the court is directed to be guided by equity and good conscience only, and by the best evidence procurable, even if not required or admissible in ordinary cases, and not to be bound by strict rules of law or equity or by any legal forms: held: that the crown 's prerogative to grant special leave to appeal is inapplicable to a decision so authorised.\" in dealing with the case, lord hobhouse observed at p.\nthey cannot look upon the decision of the supreme court as a judicial decision admitting of appeal.\nif appeals were allowed, the certain result would be to establish some system of rules;

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: but to enable the parties to have a free say, the proceedings are made confidential by law, and there is protection against action, both civil and criminal. the appeal is disposed of on the basis of the representations and the evidence. a decision of a tribunal on a dispute inter partes, in the light of pleadings and evidence, is essentially a judicial one, and this court ought to be able, on the same material, to decide in an appeal whether the decision given was correct. if no substantive law is applicable, there are questions of evidence, of burden and adequacy of proof and of the application of the principles of justice, equity and good conscience to guide the court. once it is held that the decision is that of a tribunal and subject to appeal, it is manifest that an appeal may lie, unless there be some other reason. the difficulty which arises in these cases is whether it was not the intention of the law that the decision of the central government was to be final. the law makes all allegations and counter allegations confidential. if courts cannot compel disclosure of these allegations and the veil of secrecy drawn by law is not rent, then it appears to me that a further appeal can hardly be efficacious. in this view, in my opinion, this court should not grant special leave in such cases. the situation which arises is not very different from what arose before the judicial committee in moses vs 368 parker, ex parte moses (1). the headnote adequately gives the facts, and may be quoted: \"by tasmanian act no. 10 of 1858, section 5, disputes concerning lands yet ungranted by the crown are referred to the supreme court, whose decision is to be final; and by section 8 the court is directed to be guided by equity and good conscience only, and by the best evidence procurable, even if not required or admissible in ordinary cases, and not to be bound by strict rules of law or equity or by any legal forms: held: that the crown 's prerogative to grant special leave to appeal is inapplicable to a decision so authorised.\" in dealing with the case, lord hobhouse observed at p. 248: \"the supreme court has rightly observed that her majesty 's prerogative is not taken away by the act of 1858, but intimates a doubt whether it ever came into existence. their lordships think that this doubt is well founded. they cannot look upon the decision of the supreme court as a judicial decision admitting of appeal. the court has been substituted for the commissioners to report to the governor. the difference is that their report is to be binding on him. probably it was thought that the status and training of the judges made them the most proper depositaries of that power. but that does not make their action a judicial action in the sense that it can be tested and altered by appeal. it is no more judicial than was the action of the commissioners and the governor. the court is to be guided by equity and good conscience and the best evidence. so were the commissioners. so every public officer ought to be. but they are expressly exonerated from all rules of law and equity, and all legal forms. how then can the propriety of their decision be tested on appeal? what are the canons by which this board is to be guided in advising her majesty whether the supreme court is right or wrong? it seems almost (1) 369 impossible that decisions can be varied except by reference to some rule; whereas the court making them is free from rules. if appeals were allowed, the certain result would be to establish some system of rules; and that is the very thing from which the tasmanian legislature has desired to leave the supreme court free and unfettered in each case. if it were clear that appeals ought to be allowed, such difficulties would doubtless be met somehow. but there are strong arguments to show that the matter is not of an appealable nature.\" see also the ' berge vs laudry (1). the exercise of the powers under article 136 is a counterpart of the royal prerogative to hear appeals in any cause or matter decided by courts or tribunals. but where the articles of association of a company give absolute discretion to the directors and empower them to withhold their reasons, the appeal taken to the central government would involve decision on such material, which the parties place before it. if the allegations are made confidential by law and the central government in giving its decision cannot make them public, it is manifest that the decision, to borrow lord hobhouse 's language, \"is not of an appealable nature\". whether the right to hear appeals generally against decisions of the central government acting as a tribunal be within article 136, in my opinion and i say it with great respect special leave to appeal should not be granted in such cases, unless this court is able to rend the veil of secrecy cast by the law without rending the law itself. the argument is that the allegations are confidential only so far as the public are concerned but not confidential where courts are concerned. the question is not that but one of practice of this court. this court should intervene only when practicable, and that can only arise if the parties agree not to treat the allegations as confidential. that, however, does not end the present appeals.", "completion": "in fact, the appellants before the central government made it clear that they did not charge the directors with \"capricious or mala fide conduct\" but only with arbitrary refusal, without stating any reasons.\nthe appellant company in its representation set out the history of previous refusals and the decisions of the high court of bombay and the central government, and made it clear that the action was taken in the interest of the company.\nbefore parting with the case, i may say that the report of the amendment committee had recommended amendment of section 111, and it has been amended, inter alia, by the addition of sub section (5a), which reads: \"before making an order under sub section (5) on an appeal against any refusal of the company to 371 register any transfer or transmission, the central government may require the company to disclose to it the reasons for such refusal, and on the failure or refusal of the company to disclose such reasons, that government may, notwithstanding anything contained in the articles of the company, presume that the disclosure, if made, would be unfavourable to the company.\" that would stop the blind man 's buff under the unamended law!"}

was not registered by the directors of a company, action under the of 1913 could only be taken under section 38 of the indian companies act, 1913 by petition for rectification of the share register.

been exercised reasonably, bona fide and for the benefit of the company, and unless otherwise provided by the articles, the directors were not obliged to disclose reasons on which they acted. the power had to be exercised for the benefit of the company and bona fide, but a heavy onus lay upon those challenging the resolution of the directors to displace the presumption of bona fide exercise of the power. the discretion to refuse to register transfers was not liable to be controlled unless the directors \"acted oppressively, capriciously or corruptly, or in some way mala fide\" (re bell brothers ltd. ex parte hodgson) (1). power to refuse to register transfer of shares, without assigning any reasons, or in their absolute and uncontrolled discretion, is often found in the articles of association, and exercising jurisdiction under section 38 of the indian companies act, 1913, the court may not draw unfavourable inferences from the refusal to disclose reasons in support of their resolution. the power given to the court under section 38 is now confirmed with slight modification by section 155 of the indian . under that section, the court may rectify the register of shareholders if the name of any person is without sufficient cause entered in or omitted from the register of members of a company, or default is made, or unnecessary delay has taken place in entering on the register the fact of any person having ceased to be a member. the court is in exercising this jurisdiction competent to decide any question relating to the title of the person claiming to have

exercised by the directors in the light of the powers conferred upon them by the articles of association. the respondents however submit and they are supported by the union of india that the authority

rights and the act provides for a right of appeal and makes detailed provisions about hearing and disposal according to law, it is impossible to avoid the inference that a duty is imposed upon the central government in deciding the appeal to act judicially. the attorney general contended that even if the central government was required by the provisions of the act and the rules to act judicially, the central government still not being a tribunal, this court has no power to entertain an appeal against its order or decision. but the proceedings before the central government have all the trappings of a judicial tribunal. pleadings have to be filed, evidence in support of the case of each party has to be furnished and the disputes have to be decided according to law after con sidering the representations made by the parties. if it be granted that the central government exercises judicial power of the state to adjudicate upon rights of the parties in civil matters when

and registration of transfer or transmission cannot therefore be insisted upon as a matter of right. the conditions subject to which a party can maintain a petition for an order for rectification of the register of shareholders have been settled by a long course of decisions. two of those may be noticed. in in re gresham life assurance society ex parte penney (1), the deed of settlement of a life insurance company provided that any shareholder shall be at liberty to transfer his shares to any other person who was already a shareholder, or who should be approved by the board of directors, and that no person not being already a shareholder or the executor of a shareholder, should be entitled to become the transferee of any share unless approved by the board. one j. r. de paiva who was the holder of ten shares of the company sold them to w. j. penney and lodged the transfer with the shares for registration at the company 's office. the directors in exercise of the powers conferred upon them by the deed of settlement refused to register the shares. in a joint summons taken out by paiva and penney under section 35 of the companies act, 1862, the master of the rolls directed the transfer to be registered, the directors of the company having failed to submit any reasonable ground or objection to the purchaser. in the view of the master of the rolls, it was for the court to judge whether the objection was reasonable and that objection must be disclosed to the court. against this order, the company approached the court of appeal. james l. j. in dealing with the contention

(1) where the court of appeal held that where the directors of the company had uncontrolled and absolute discretion to refuse to register any transfer of shares, while such powers are of a fiduciary nature and must be, exercised in the interest of the company, the petition for registration of transfer should be dismissed unless there is something to show that they had been otherwise exercised. rectification of the register under section 155 can therefore be granted only if the transferor establishes that the directors had, in refusing to register the shares in the names of a transferee, acted oppressively, capriciously or corruptly, or in some way mala fide and not in the interest of the company. such a plea has, in a petition for rectification, to be expressly raised and affirmatively proved by evidence. normally, the court would presume that where the directors have refused to register the transfer of shares when they have been invested with absolute discretion to refuse registration, that the exercise of the power was bona fide. when (1) 356 the new companies act was enacted, it was well settled that the discretionary power conferred by the articles of association to refuse to register would be presumed to be properly exercised and it was for the aggrieved transferor to show affirmatively that it had been exercised mala fide and not in the interest of the company. before the committee appointed by the government of india under the chairmanship of mr. c. h. bhabha representation was made by several bodies that this power which was intended to be exercised for the benefit of the company was being misused and the committee with a view to afford some reasonable safeguards against such misuse of the power recommended that a right of appeal should be provided against refusal to register transfer of shares. the legislature, it appears, ,accepted this suggestion and provided a right of appeal. but the power to entertain the appeal is not unrestricted: being an alternative to the right to approach the civil court, it must be subject to the same limitations which are implicit in the exercise of the power by the civil court under section 155. the central government may therefore exercise the power to order that the transfer which the directors have in their discretion refused, be registered if it is satisfied that the exercise of the discretion is mala fide, arbitrary or capricious and that it is in the interest of the company that the transfer should be registered. relying upon el.(7) of section 111 which provided that the proceedings in appeals under sub section(3) or in relation thereto shall be confidential, it was urged that the authority hearing the appeal is not obliged to set out reasons in support of its conclusion and it must be assumed that in disposing of the appeal, the authority acted properly and directed registration of shares.", "completion": "i am therefore of opinion that in order to preserve to the company the right which is given by the articles a shareholder is not to be put upon the register if the board of directors do not assent to him, and it is absolutely necessary that they should not be bound to give their reasons although i perfectly agree that if it can be shown affirmatively that they are exercising their power capriciously and wantonly, that may be a ground for the court interfering\".\n(1) where the court of appeal held that where the directors of the company had uncontrolled and absolute discretion to refuse to register any transfer of shares, while such powers are of a fiduciary nature and must be, exercised in the interest of the company, the petition for registration of transfer should be dismissed unless there is something to show that they had been otherwise exercised.\nnormally, the court would presume that where the directors have refused to register the transfer of shares when they have been invested with absolute discretion to refuse registration, that the exercise of the power was bona fide.\nbhabha representation was made by several bodies that this power which was intended to be exercised for the benefit of the company was being misused and the committee with a view to afford some reasonable safeguards against such misuse of the power recommended that a right of appeal should be provided against refusal to register transfer of shares."}

requests for registration, but they were again declined, and appeals were filed before the central, government under section 111(3) of the , which had come into force from april 1, 1956. these appeals

any reasons. the appeals 360 succeeded, and the shares were ordered to be registered. the deputy secretary, who heard and decided the appeals, gave no reasons for his decision. against his order, the present appeals have been filed with special leave. the preliminary objection is that the appeals are incompetent, because the central government, which heard them, is not a tribunal muchless a court, and the action of the central government is purely administrative. it is, therefore, submitted that article 136 does not apply, because special leave can only be granted in respect of a determination by a court or a tribunal, which the central government is not. this is not the only provision of law, under which the central or state governments have been empowered to hear appeals, revisions or reviews, and it is thus necessary to find out the exact status of the central government when it hears and decides appeals, etc., for the application of article 136. article 136(1) reads as follows: \"notwithstanding anything in this chapter, the supreme court may in its discretion, grant special leave to appeal from any judgment, decree, determination, sentence or order in any cause or matter passed or made by any court or tribunal in the territory of india. \" the orders which the central government passes, certainly fall within the words \"determination\" and \"order\". the proceeding before the central government also falls within the wide words \"any cause or matter\". the only question is whether the central government, when it hears and decides an appeal, can be said to be acting as a court or tribunal. that the central government is not a court was assumed at the hearing. but to ascertain what falls within the expression \"court or tribunal\", one has to begin with \"courts\". the word \"court\" is not defined in the . it is not defined in the civil procedure code. the definition in the indian evidence act is not exhaustive, and is for the purposes of that act. in the now english dictionary (vol. ii, pp. 1090, 1091), the meaning given is: 361 \"an assembly of judges or other persons legally appointed and acting as a tribunal to hear and determine any cause, civil, ecclesiastical, military or naval. \" all tribunals are not courts, though all courts are tribunals. the word \"courts\" is used to designate those tribunals which are set up in an organised state for the administration of justice. by administration of justice is meant the exercise of judicial power of the state to maintain and uphold rights and to punish \"wrongs\". whenever there is an infringement of a right or an injury, the courts are there to restore the vinculum juris, which is disturbed. judicial power, according to griffith, c. j. in huddart, parker & co. proprietary ltd. vs moorehead (1) means: \"the power which every sovereign authority must of necessity have to decide controversies between its subjects, or between itself and its subjects, whether the rights relate to life, liberty or property. the exercise of this power does not begin until some tribunal which has power to give a binding and authoritative decision (whether subject to appeal or not) is called upon to take action. \" when rights are infringed or invaded, the aggrieved party can go and commence a querela before the ordinary civil courts. these courts which are instrumentalities of government, are invested with the judicial power of the state, and their authority is derived from the constitution or some act of legislature constituting them. their number is ordinarily fixed and they are ordinarily permanent, and can try any suit or cause within their jurisdiction. their numbers may be increased or decreased, but they are almost always permanent and go under the compendious name of \"courts of civil judicature\". there can thus be no doubt that the central government does not come within this class. with the growth of civilisation and the problems of modern life, a large number of administrative tribunals have come into existence. these tribunals have the authority of law to pronounce upon valuable (1) ; , 357.362 rights; they act in a judicial manner and even on evidence on oath, but they are not part of the ordinary courts of civil judicature. they share the exercise of the judicial power of the state, but they are brought into existence to implement some administrative policy or to determine controversies arising out of some administrative law. they are very similar to courts, but are not courts.", "completion": "the preliminary objection is that the appeals are

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: when the constitution speaks of 'courts ' in article 136, 227 or 228 or in art,% 233 to 237 or in the lists, it contemplates courts of civil judicature but not tribunals other than such courts. this is the reason for using both the expressions in articles 136 and 227. by \"courts\" is meant courts of civil judicature and by \"tribunals\", those bodies of men who are appointed to decide controversies arising under certain special laws. among the powers of the state is included the power to decide such controversies. this is undoubtedly one of the attributes of the state, and is aptly called the judicial power of the state. in the exercise of this power, a clear division is thus noticeable. broadly speaking, certain special matters go before tribunals, and the residue goes before the ordinary courts of civil judicature. their procedures may differ, but the functions are not essentially different. what distinguishes them has never been success fully established. lord stamp said that the real distinction is that courts have \"an air of detachment\". but this is more a matter of age and tradition and is not of the essence. many tribunals, in recent years, have acquitted themselves so well and with such detachment as to make this test insufficient. lord sankey, l.c. in shell company of australia vs federal commissioner of taxation (1) observed: \"the authorities are clear to show that there are tribunals with many of the trappings of a court, which, nevertheless, are not courts in the strict sense of exercising judicial power. in that connection it may be useful to enumerate some negative propositions on this subject: 1. a tribunal is not necessarily a court in this strict sense because it gives a final decision. nor because it hears (1) [1931] a.c.275.363 witnesses on oath. nor because two or more contending parties appear before it between whom it,, has to decide. nor because it gives decisions which affect the rights of subjects. nor because there is an appeal to a court. nor because it is a body to which a matter is referred by another body. see rex vs electricity commissioners in my opinion, a court in 'the strict sense is a tribunal which is a part of the ordinary hierarchy of courts of civil judicature maintained by the state under its constitution to exercise the judicial power of the state. these courts perform all the judicial functions of the state except those that are excluded by law from their jurisdiction. the word \"judicial\", be it noted, is itself capable of two meanings. they were admirably stated by lopes, l.j. in royal aquarium and summer and winter garden society vs parkinson (2), in these words: \"the word 'judicial ' has two meanings. it may refer to the discharge of duties exercisable by a judge or by justices in court, or to administrative duties which need not be performed in court, but in respect of which it is necessary to bring to bear a judicial mind that is, a mind to determine what is fair and just in respect of the matters under con sideration. \" that an officer is required to decide matters before him \"judicially\" in the second sense does not make him a court or even a tribunal, because that only establishes that he is following a standard of conduct, and is free from

others, which are not so included. now, the matter would have been simple, if the had designated a person or persons whether by name or by office for the purpose of hearing an appeal under section 111. it would then have been clear that though such person or persons were not \"courts\" in the sense explained, they were clearly (1) (2) , 452, 364 \"tribunals\". the act says that an appeal shall lie to the central government. we are, therefore, faced with the question whether the central government can be said to be a tribunal. reliance is placed upon a recent decision of this court in shivji nathubai vs the union of india (1), where it was held that the central government in exercising power of review under the mineral concession rules, 1949, was subject to the appellate jurisdiction conferred by article 136. in that case which came to this court on appeal from the high court 's order under article 226, it was held on the authority of province of bombay vs kushaldas section advani (1) and rex vs electricity commissioners (3) that the action of the central government was quasi judicial and not administrative. it was then observed: \"it is in the circumstances apparent that as soon as r. 52 gives a right to an aggrieved party to apply for review a lis is created between him and the party in whose favour the grant has been made. unless therefore there is anything in the statute to the contrary it will be the duty of the authority to act judicially and its decision would be a quasi judicial act. \" this observation only establishes that the decision is a quasi judicial one, but it does not say that the central government can be regarded as a tribunal. in my opinion, these are very different matters, and now that the question has been raised, it should be decided. the function that the central government performs under the act and the rules is to hear an appeal against the action of the directors.", "completion": "lord sankey, l.c. in shell company of

was delivered by raghubar dayal, j. this appeal, by special leave, is against the judgment of the punjab high court dismissing the appellant 's appeal and confirming his conviction under section 302 and section 307 read with section 149, indian penal code. the case for the prosecution was that the appellant and twelve other persons who were tried with him, had, on account of a dispute about the possession of a plot of land, assaulted darshan, deceased, and his companions, when they were returning from their fields and that darshan singh and his companions also struck the appellant 's party in self defence. in the incident, darshan and nand lal received injuries on the one side while daya ram, hamela and kartar singh the appellant, received injuries on the appellant 's side. darshan singh died on account of the injuries received. daya ram stated that when be, kartar singh, hamela and a few other persons were going near about their field, darshan, nand lal and others, who happened to be sitting on a well, challenged them and nand lal remarked that he would not let him (daya ram) escape. at this fight ensued between both the parties in which injuries were inflicted on each, other. daya ram said that he did not know who speared darshan, deceased. 397 kartar singh stated that a member of nand lal 's party caused a spear blow in his abdomen and that he then ran away. he states that he did not cause any injury to anybody. hamela stated that darshan and others assaulted his party when they were going to plough the land in dispute and that they caused them, injuries in selfdefence. the learned sessions judge, after noting the allegations of the parties and the admitted facts about the dispute with respect to the plot of land, said: \"it is also not denied that the parties in this case instead of taking resort to law wanted to force the issue by the force of arms and for that purpose both the parties collected number of persons from seel and other villages who were armed with deadly weapons such as spears, gandasis and sticks and in order to decide the issue had a pitched fight which was pre concerted. the public prosecutor therefore maintained that under these circumstances the question of right of self defence to any party does not arise. \" the learned sessions judge also said: \"this proposition of law has not been challenged by the defence. as observed above, in this case, both the parties, in order to assert their rights, had a free fight which was pre concerted with the set purpose of forcing the issue mentioned above. \" he further said: \"the only point therefore which requires determination in this case is whether all or only some of the accused did participate in this assault,\" and came to the conclusion that three accused, viz., daya ram, hamela and kartar singh, who had admitted their presence in the incident and had received injuries, were proved to have taken part in that free fight, and that the participation of the other ten accused in the case was not established beyond doubt. he, however, said: \"although i feel that daya ram, hamela and kartara accused were accompanied by at least 9 or 51 398 10 persons, but it is difficult to say who those 9 or 10 persons were.\" he therefore acquitted those ten persons giving them the benefit of doubt. the three convicted persons preferred an appeal to the high court. two questions were urged at the hearing. one was that when there was no evidence that there were more than five persons in the fight on the side of the appellants, the learned sessions judge could not, in law, record a conviction under section 302 read with section 149, he having acquitted the other ten persons specifically named by the p. ws., as being the companions of the appellants. the other point was that the other party was the aggressor. the high court, on the first point, said. : \"the circumstances of this case leave no manner of doubt in our mind that there were a large number of persons on the side of the appellants and this number must have exceeded five, and was more or less near the number of persons who were actually accused in the case. \" on the second point, it said: \"we have no manner of doubt in our mind that there is no question of right of private defence and it is a clear case of a free fight between both the parties. it would not therefore be of any importance as to who gave the first lalkara and who started the fight. \" it further held that the appellant 's party formed an unlawful assembly and its common object was to cause injuries to the opposite side which could result in the ordinary course of nature in death and, consequently, the conviction of the three appellants, whose participation could not be doubted, under sections 302 and 307 read with section

and the short question which the appeal raises for our decision is whether the magistrate who entertained the application made before him by respondent 2 under section 234 was an inferior criminal court under section 439 of the code of criminal procedure. before dealing with this point it is relevant to refer to the scheme of the material provisions of the regulation. section 153 confers power on the municipality to order removal or repair of buildings which may be found in a dangerous state. under this section the committee may by notice require the owner of the building, wall or structure to remove the same forthwith or cause such repairs as the committee may consider necessary for the public safety. this section also empowers the committee to take at the expense of the owner any steps which it thinks necessary for the purpose of averting imminent danger. if the owner on whom a notice is served under section 153 complies with the requisition nothing more need be done. if, however, the owner does not comply with the requisition served on him the committee is empowered to cause the repairs to be made after six hours notice to the owner under section 220. this section provides that whenever the terms of any notice issued under this regulation have not been complied with the committee may, after six hours ' notice, cause the act to be done by its officers. as a corollary to this provision, and indeed as its consequence, section 222 empowers the committee to recover the cost of the work done 269 under section 220. section 222(1) authorises the committee to recover the cost of the work from the person in default. sub sections (2) and (3) of section 222 then deal with the question as to which person should be held to be in default, the owner or the occupier; with that question we are not concerned in the present appeal. sub section (4) of section 222 provides that where any money recoverable by the committee under this section is payable by the owner of the property, it shall be charged thereon and shall be recoverable as if it were a tax levied by the committee on the property. by sub section (5) it is provided that the contract between the owner and the occupier is not affected by this section. it is under section 222(4) that a demand notice was served on the appellant by respondent 2. that takes us to section 234 which provides for the machinery of recovery of municipal claims.", "completion": "on june 13,1950, the municipal committee, ajmer, respondent 2, issued a notice against the appellant, the durgah committee, ajmer, under section 153 of the ajmer merwara municipalities regulation, 1925 (vi of 1925) (hereafter called the regulation) calling upon it to carry out certain repairs in the jhalra wall which was in a dilapidated condition.\nthe appellant did not comply with the said requisition and so respondent 2 served another notice on the appellant under section 220 of the regulation inti mating to it that the required repairs would be carried out at the expense of respondent 2 and that the cost incurred by it would be recovered from the appellant.\na notice of demand in that behalf was issued on the appellant on april 1, 1952, and in pursuance of the said notice respondent 2 applied to the additional tehsildar and magistrate ii class, ajmer, for the recovery of the said amount under section 234 of the regulation.\nbefore the high court, on behalf of respondent 1, the state of rajasthan, as well as respondent 2, a preliminary objection was raised that the criminal revision application filed by the appellant was incompetent since the magistrate who entertained respondent 2 's application made under section 234 \",as not an inferior criminal court under section 439 of the code of criminal procedure.\nit is against this order that the appellant has come to this court by special leave;

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: this section provides, inter alia, that any tax claimable or recoverable by a committee under this regulation, after demand has been made therefor in the manner prescribed by rule, be recovered on application to a magistrate having jurisdiction within the limits of the municipality or in any other place where the person by whom the amount is payable may for the time being reside, by the distress and sale of any movable property within the limits of such magistrate 's jurisdiction belonging to such person. the proviso to this section prescribes that nothing in this section shall prevent the committee at its discretion from suing for the amount payable in any competent civil court. it would thus be seen that the object of making an application to the magistrate is to obtain an order from the magistrate direct ing the recovery of the tax claimable or recoverable by distress and sale of any movable property belonging to the defaulter. it is under this section that tile magistrate was moved by respondent 2. that in brief is the scheme of the material provisions of the regulation. the main argument which mt . chatterjee, for the appellant, has pressed before us is that in determining the nature of the proceedings under section 234 and the character of the magistrate who entertains an application made under the said section, it is important to 35 270 bear in mind that a person in the position of the appellant has no other opportunity to challenge the validity of the notice as well as the validity of the claim made against him by the committee. the argument is that it would be open to the owner to contend that the notice issued under section 153 is invalid or frivolous. it would also be open to him to contend that the amount sought to be recovered from him is excessive and that even if the repairs were carried out they could not have cost as much, and since the scheme of the regulation shows that it provides no opportunity to the owner to raise those contentions except in proceedings under section 234 the nature of the proceedings and the character of the magistrate who entertains them should be liberally construed. the proceedings should be deemed to be judicial proceedings and the magistrate should be held to be an inferior criminal court when he entertains the said proceedings. if the assumption on which the argument proceeds that the regulation provides no other opportunity to the owner to challenge the notice or to question the amount claimed from him were sound then there would be some force in the contention that section 234 should be liberally construed in favour of the appellant. but is that assumption right? the answer to this question would depend upon the examination of three relevant provisions of the regulation; they are sections 222(4), 93 and 226. we have already seen that section 222(4) provides that any money recoverable by the committee under section 222(1) shall be recovered as if it were a tax levied by the committee on the property and shall be charged thereon. section 93 provides for appeals against taxation. section 93(1) lays down, inter alia, that an appeal against the assessment or levy of any tax under this regulation shall lie to the deputy commissioner or to such officer as may be empowered by the state government in this behalf. the remaining five subsections of section 93 prescribe the manner in which the appeal should be tried and disposed of. if the amount recoverable by respondent 2 from the appellant is made recoverable as if it were 271 a tax levied by the committee, then against the levy of such a tax an appeal would be competent under section 93(1). mr. chatterjee argues that section 93(1) provides for an appeal against the levy of a tax, and he draws a distinction between the amount made recoverable as if it were a tax and the amount recoverable as a tax. his contention is that the amount which is recoverable under section 222(1) is no doubt by fiction deemed to be a tax but against an amount thus deem.s. 93(1). we are not impressed by this argument. if by the fiction introduced by section 222(4) the amount in question is to be deemed as if it were a tax it is obvious that full effect must be given to this legal fiction; and in consequence just as a result of the said section the recovery procedure prescribed by section 234 becomes available to the committee so would the right of making an appeal prescribed by section 93(1) be available to the appellant. the consequence of the fiction inevitably is that the amount in question can be recovered as a tax and the right to challenge the levy of the tax accrues to the appellant. this position is made perfectly clear by section 226. this section provides, inter alia, that where any order of a kind referred to in section 222 is subject to appeal, and an appeal has been instituted against it, all proceedings to enforce such order shall be suspended pending the decision of the appeal, and if such order is set aside on appeal, disobedience thereto shall not be deemed to be an offence. it is obvious that this section postulates that an order passed under section 222 is appealable and it provides that if an appeal is made against such an order further proceedings would be stayed.", "completion": "this section provides, inter alia, that any tax claimable or recoverable by a committee under this regulation, after demand has been made therefor in the manner prescribed by rule, be recovered on application to a magistrate having jurisdiction within the limits of the municipality or in any other place where the person by whom the amount is payable may for the time being reside, by the distress and sale of any movable property within the limits of such magistrate 's jurisdiction belonging to such person.\nit would also be open to him to contend that the amount sought to be recovered from him is excessive and that even if the repairs were carried out they could not have cost as much, and since the scheme of the regulation shows that it provides no opportunity to the owner to raise those contentions except in proceedings under section 234 the nature of the proceedings and the character of the magistrate who entertains them should be liberally construed.\nif the assumption on which the argument proceeds that the regulation provides no other opportunity to the owner to challenge the notice or to question the amount claimed from him were sound then there would be some force in the contention that section 234 should be liberally construed in favour of the appellant.\nif the amount recoverable by respondent 2 from the appellant is made recoverable as if it were 271 a tax levied by the committee, then against the levy of such a tax an appeal would be competent under section 93(1).\nif by the fiction introduced by section 222(4) the amount in question is to be deemed as if it were a tax it is obvious that full effect must be given to this legal fiction; and in consequence just as a result of the said section the recovery procedure prescribed by section 234 becomes available to the committee so would the right of making an appeal prescribed by section 93(1) be available to the appellant."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: it is common ground that there is no other provision in the regulation providing for an appeal against an order made under section 222(1); and so inevitably we go back to section 93 which provides for an appeal against the levy of a tax. it would be idle to contend that though section 226 assumes that an appeal lies against an order made under section 222(1) the legislature has for. gotten to provide for such an appeal. therefore, in our opinion, there can be no doubt that reading 272 sections 222, 93 and 226 together the conclusion is inescapable that an appeal lies under section 93(1) against the demand made by the committee on the owner of the property under section 222(1). if that be so, the main, if not the sole argument, urged in support of the liberal construction of section 234 turns out to be fallacious. ow, looking at section 234 it is clear that the proceedings initiated before a magistrate are no more than recovery proceedings. all questions which may legiti mately be raised against the validity of the notice served under section 153 or against the validity of the claim made by the committee under section 222 can and ought to be raised in an appeal under section 93(1), and if no appeal is preferred or an appeal is preferred and is dismissed then all those points are concluded and can no more be raised in proceedings under section 234. that is why the nature of the enquiry contemplated by section 234 is very limited and it prima facie partakes of the character 'of a ministerial enquiry rather than judicial enquiry. in any event it is difficult to hold that the magistrate who entertains the application is an inferior criminal court. the claim made before him is for the recovery of a tax and the order prayed for is for the recovery of the tax by distress and sale of the movable property of the defaulter. if at all, this would at best be a proceeding of a civil nature and not criminal. that is why, we think, whatever may be the character of the proceedings, whether it is purely ministerial or judicial or quasi judicial, the magistrate who entertains the application and holds the enquiry does so because he is designated in that behalf and so he must be treated as a persona designata and not as a magistrate functioning and exercising his authority under the code of criminal proce dure. he cannot therefore be regarded as an inferior criminal court. that is the view taken by the high court and we see no reason to differ from it. in the present appeal it is unnecessary to consider what would be the character of the proceedings before a competent civil court contemplated by the proviso. prima facie such proceedings can be no more than execution proceedings. 273 mr. chatterjee also attempted to argue that the proceedings under section 234 taken against the appellant by respondent 2 were incompetent because a demand, has not been made by respondent 2 on the appellant in the manner prescribed by rule as required by section 234. it does appear that rules have not been framed under the regulation and so no form has been prescribed for making a demand under section 222(1). therefore the argument is that unless the rules are framed and the form of notice is prescribed for making a demand under section 222(1) no demand can be said to have been made in the manner prescribed by rules and so an application cannot be made under section 234. there are two obvious answers to this contention. the first answer is that if the revisional application made by the appellant before the high court was incompetent this question could not have been urged before the high court because it was part of the merits of the case and so cannot be agitated before us either. as soon as it is held that the magistrate was not an inferior criminal court the revisional application filed by the appellant before the high court must be deemed to be incompetent and rejected on that preliminary ground alone. besides, on the merits we see no substance in the argument. if the rules are not prescribed then all that can be said is that there is no form prescribed for issuing a demand notice; that does not mean. that the statutory power conferred on the committee by section 222(1) to make a demand is unenforceable. as a result of the notice served by respondent 2 against the appellant respondent 2 was entitled to make the necessary repairs at its cost and make a demand for reimbursement of the said cost. that is the plain effect of the relevant provisions of the regulation; and so, an amount which was claimable by virtue of section 222(1) does not cease to be claimable just because rules have not been framed prescribing the form for making the said demand. in our opinion, therefore, the contention that the application made under section 234 was incompetent must be rejected. it now remains to consider some decisions to which 274 our attention was drawn. in crown through municipal committee, ajmer vs amba lal (1), the judicial commissioner mr. norman held that a magistrate entertaining an application under section 234 of the regulation is an inferior criminal court. the only reason given in sup port of this view appears to be that the magistrate before whom an application under the said section is made is appointed under the code of criminal procedure, and so he is a criminal court although he is not dealing with crime.", "completion": "chatterjee also attempted to argue that the proceedings under section 234 taken against the appellant by respondent 2 were incompetent because a demand, has not been made by respondent 2 on the appellant in the manner prescribed by rule as required by section 234.\nit does appear that rules have not been framed under the regulation and so no form has been prescribed for making a demand under section 222(1).\ntherefore the argument is that unless the rules are framed and the form of notice is prescribed for making a demand under section 222(1) no demand can be said to have been made in the manner prescribed by rules and so an application cannot be made under section 234.\nthat is the plain effect of the relevant provisions of the regulation;

1947, and section 7 of the essential supplies act, 1946. there wets a further charge under section, 8 of the essential supplies act against three of these accused, darshan singh begning on of them. 321 the allegation against all the accused, in substance, was that they conspired to export 76 bags of mill made cloth to pakistan without a permit, by smuggling them through the customs barrier near wagha, on the morning of the 26th ,may, 1948. wagha is., about 18 miles from amritsar, and at a distance of nearly half a mile from this place lies the actual indo pakistan border. between the customs barrier and the border there is a small police post and almost opposite the police post is the customs office which is located in a tent. the prosecution case ' is that at about 7 a. m. on the 26th of may, 1948, a truck, loaded with a large quantity of millmade cloth owned by the accused ram singh, arrived at the customs barrier near wagha. rajendra singh, another accused, who was on duty at that time as the customs supervisor, allowed the truck to pass through and the truck stopped near the customs office on the side of the police post. as soon as the truck stopped, darshan singh, who was the deputy superintendent in charge of the customs barrier, and attar singh, who was a customs preventive officer at amritsar and was then under order of transfer to some other place, went to the police station and asked kulraj, the sub inspector in charge of the same, to allow the lorry to pass through upto the border. kulraj did not accede to this request and thereupon both darshan singh and attar singh went back to the customs tent. the truck was then unloaded and the goods were handed over to a large number of coolies who began carrying them towards the border, being followed by both attar singh and ram singh. a little later, kailash chandra, a police sub inspector of amritsar who was at that time on special duty in connection with checking and detec tion of smuggling cases, arrived at the place on a motor bicycle and being informed by kulraj of what had happened before, both he and kulraj proceeded in his motor cycle towards the border and overtook the coolies who were carrying the goods. the coolies were rounded up and brought back to the border along 322 with attar singh, though ram singh managed to slip away. kailash chandra made a report of the occurrence to inder singh, who was the head of the special police establishment at delhi dealing with smuggling cases, and after a detailed investigation, the five accused were sent up to take their trial. the trying magistrate convicted all of them under section 120 b of the indian penal code, read with section 3/10 of the east 'punjab cotton cloth and yarn order, 1947, and sentenced them to rigorous imprisonment for a period of one year each. attar singh was further convicted under section 7 of the essential supplies act and darshan singh under section 8 of the said act, and there was a sentence of one year 's rigorous imprisonment and a fine of rs. 1,000 upon each one of them under these sections, the sentence of rigorous imprisonment to run concurrently with that on the previous charges. against this judgment there was an appeal taken by all the accused to the court of the sessions judge at amritsar. the additional sessions judge, who heard the appeal, acquitted two of the accused but maintained the conviction of the other three, namely, attar singh, ram singh and darshan singh, though their sentences were reduced. thereupon these three persons presented three separate revision petitions to the high court of east punjab at simla which were heard and disposed of by mr. justice khosla sitting singly. the learned judge dismissed the revision petitions but granted a certificate under article

(1) 45) imposing prohibitions on export of various descriptions of goods specified therein. the defence of india rules were due to expire on the 30th september, 1946. on the 26th september, 1946, the essential supplies ordinance was passed and this was later replaced by the essential supplies act. on the very day that this ordinance ,was passed, another ordinance, being ordinance no. xx of 1946, was promulgated, which inter alia continued the provisions of the defence of india rules relating to prohibition and restriction of import and export of goods. subsequently on the 26th of march, 1947, the im ports and exports (control) act was passed, which dealt comprehensively with the subject of control over exports and imports. as it would be unnatural to suppose that the legislature was legislating on the same subject simultaneously by two parallel sets of legislation existing side by side, it is argued that export and import of goods were not within the scope and intendment of the essential supplies act. 328 these arguments though somewhat plausible at first sight, do not appear to us to be sound or convincing. it is a cardinal rule of interpretation that the language used by the legislature is the true depository of the legislative intent, and that words and phrases occurring in a statute are to be taken not in an isolated or detached manner dissociated from the context, but are to be read together and construed in the light of the purpose and object of the act itself. the object of the essential supplies act, as set out in the preamble, was to provide for the continuance, during a limited period of time, of the power to control the production, supply and distribution of, and trade and commerce in, foodstuffs, cotton and woollen textiles, petroleum, iron and other essential commodities, a list of which appeared in the act itself.", "completion": "\" the point for our consideration is, whether the above provisions which prohibit inter alia the export of certain essential commodities to any country outside india without a permit and make the violation of such provisions an offence, were validly made by the governor in exercise of the powers delegated to him under section 4 of the essential supplies (temporary powers) act 1946 ?\nsection 3 of the essential supplies act, it is true, authorised the central government to make provisions for regulating and prohibiting the production, supply and distribution of the essential commodities specified in the act and also trade and commerce therein; but it is argued by the learned counsel that the expression, \" trade and commerce \", as used in the section, must be taken to mean trade and commerce within a province or at the most between provinces inter se, but it cannot include any transaction by way of exporting goods outside india.\nit is said, therefore, that the essential supplies act purported to deal exclusively with provincial matters, and import and export of goods outside the indian territory, being a central subject, could not reasonably be brought within the purview of the act.\nthe other line of reasoning that is put forward in support of the argument is, that the intention of the central legis lature not to include export and import within the provisions of the essential supplies act is evidenced by the fact, that the central legislature dealt with export and import of goods separately, and by an, altogether different set of enactments which exist side by side with the essential supplies act and other legislation of the same type preceding it.\nas it would be unnatural to suppose that the legislature was legislating on the same subject simultaneously by two parallel sets of legislation existing side by side, it is argued that export and import of goods were not within the scope and intendment of the essential supplies act."}

and that is plainly the reason why a reference to that statute was made in the second paragraph, of the preamble. but from this it cannot be argued that the central legislature was legislating only in exercise of the powers which it derived from the british parliament and that it did not exercise the powers which it itself had under the government of india act. it is not disputed that the central legislature was fully competent to legislate on exports and imports which are central subjects and in making any provision relating thereto, it cannot be said that it acted in excess of its authority. even taking the legislation to be purely on the provincial subjects of production, distribution and supply of goods, restriction of export as ancillary to production and supply of essential commodities would, in our opinion, be quite within the scope and ambit of such legislation and in pith and substance it would be an enactment dealing exclusively with these provincial matters. looked at from this standpoint, the other argument advanced by mr. achhru ram would also be found to be without any substance. the imports and exports act or the earlier order and ordinance, referred to by the learned counsel, were legislation essentially on the subject of exports and imports. their object was to regulate or control imports and exports generally and they dealt with a large variety of articles far outnumbering those enumerated in the essential supplies act. the object of the imports and exports act was not to regulate production and distribution of commodities considered essential to the community 330 and it was not as a means to secure that object that it purported to prohibit or restrict exporting of goods. thus the scope and purpose of the two sets of legislation were totally different and there was nothing wrong if they existed side by the side and were in operation at one and the same time, we are not told that there was any overlapping of the provisions of these two statutes; and as the competency of the legislature to enact both these sets of provisions is not disputed, we do not think that any occasional overlapping, even if it is assumed to exist, would be at all material. in our opinion, therefore, the contentions raised in regard to the constitutional point involved in these appeals are unsupportable and could not be accepted. as the appeals have come up before us on the strength of a certificate granted under article. 132(1) of the constitution, the appellants are not entitled to challenge the propriety of the decision appealed against on a ground other than that on which the certificate was given except with the leave of this court as provided for by clause (3) of article 132 of the constitution. at the close of the arguments of the parties in regard to the constitutional point referred, to above. , we made it clear to the learned counsel appearing for both the appellants that we would not allow any question relating to the merits of the cases to be raised before us which turned merely on appreciation of evidence by the courts below. mr. umrigar, who appeared for attar singh the appellant in case no. 12, however stated to us that he would crave leave to bring to our notice one important matter which, according to him, resulted in grave miscarriage of justice at least so far as his client was concerned. he pointed out that both the additional sessions judge and the learned judge of the high court in deciding the case against his client relied upon an admission alleged to have been made by the latter that he was present at the customs barrier at wagha on the morning of the day of occurrence and had gone there to say good bye to the customs staff, he 331 being under an order of transfer from amritsar to gurdaspur.", "completion": "section 3, which is the most material part of the act,, authorised the central government, whenever it considered expedient or necessary, for maintaining or increasing supplies of any essential commodity or for securing their equitable distribution and availability at fair prices, to provide by notified order, for regulating or prohibiting, the production, supply and distribution thereof or trade and commerce therein.\nas 329 the main object of the legislation was the continuance of control over the production, supply and distribution of commodities considered essential to the community and as these are provincial subjects, the central legislature in legislating on them must have to invoke the powers conferred upon it by the india (central government and legislature) act, 1946 (9 & 10 geo.\neven taking the legislation to be purely on the provincial subjects of production, distribution and supply of goods, restriction of export as ancillary to production and supply of essential commodities would, in our opinion, be quite within the scope and ambit of such legislation and in pith and substance it would be an enactment dealing exclusively with these provincial matters.\nthe object of the imports and exports act was not to regulate production and distribution of commodities considered essential to the community 330 and it was not as a means to secure that object that it purported to prohibit or restrict exporting of goods."}

and he invited us to examine the evidence ourselves and come to our own decision on the point. without in any way disputing our right to adopt this course in cases where it may be considered necessary, we think that in the circumstances of the present case the proper order to make will be to direct a rehearing of the appeal by the session& court on the evidence as it actually stands after excluding from consideration the alleged admission of attar singh. there can be no doubt 333 that the supposed admission was of a very damaging character and was highly prejudicial to the accused. it is quite,, problematic to value its effect upon the minds of the judges in the courts below and it is difficult for us to say that had it been excluded from consideration the courts would have come to the same decision of guilt or that conversely a verdict of acquittal would have been a perverse one. in such cases, the function of this court, which is not an ordinary court of criminal appeal, is not so much to weigh and appraise the evidence again to find out the guilt or innocence of the accused as to see that the accused gets a fair trial on proper evidence. it has been argued by mr. achhru ram, and in our opinion quite rightly, that if the case of attar singh is to be heard afresh, the same order should be made in the case of darshan singh as well. not only are the two cases closely interconnected, but so far as darshan singh is concerned the prosecution sought to establish his complicity. in the affair primarily by adducing evidence to show that he was in the company of attar singh when both of them approached kulraj, the officer in charge of the police station, and requested him to allow the truck to pass through.", "completion": "there is no doubt that the additional sessions judge as well as the high court did refer in their respective judgments to the alleged admission of attar singh and rely upon the same to arrive at their decision in the case.\n\" the high court in referring to the said admission observed as follows: \" attar singh admitted that he was present at the barrier on that morning but the explanation he gave was this.\nin order to clear up the matter we had the further hearing of the case adjourned to enable the advocate general to produce before us the written statement, if any, that was filed by attar singh in the trial court.\nthe advocate general contends that even if there was an error committed by the courts below in this respect, we should nevertheless dismiss the appeal inasmuch as there is sufficient evidence to support the conviction of the accused independently of the so called admission of attar singh;

the rest of the smaller shrines are outside the premises of the main temple. each of the said temples has its own manager, archakas and separate endowments; but, presumably because of the fact that the alwar8 and acharyas, whose idols are installed in the smaller temples, were originally devotees of sri athinathalwar, an interesting and novel practice of mutual and regular exchange of visits between the idols in the smaller shrines and the idol of athinathalwar has grown over the years. during certain specified occasions in the year, the idols in the minor temples are brought to the main temple for worship; so too, on specific occasions the idol of athinathalwar is also taken to the minor shrines; such visits being reminiscent of the days when the alwars and acharya8 worshiped in the temple of athinathalwar. sri ramanujacharya was one of the greatest of the devotees of lord vishnu and is well known throughout this vast country as the progenitor of an important school of indian philosophy. he died in the year 1127 a. d. in the 13th century a shrine was built in his honour and his idol was installed therein. sri ramanujacharya is also known as udayavar or emberumanar and the shrine built in his dedication is known as emberumanar temple. the manager and archaka of the said temple is known as emberumanar 512 jeer. emberumanar temple also is outside the precincts of the temple of athinathalwar. there are also mutual visits between the idol of emberumanar and the idol of athinathalwar to each other 's temple. the present emberumanar jeer is the plaintiff in the suits out of which the appeals have arisen. there is a mutt called the vanamamalai mutt in the said district and the head of the mutt is known as vanamamalai jeer. he is a sanyasi held in reverence by vaishnavites of south india. he is the first defendant. the heads of the ahobilam mutt and the tirukkurungudi mutt are the second and third defendants respectively. the fourth defendant is the executive officer of the temple of sri athinathalwar and he was appointed by the hindu religious endowments board, madras. the records disclose that, at any rate from the middle of the last century, there have been disputes between the various jeers and others as regards the order of priority in which certain honours have to be distributed among the said jeers when they attend the temple of sri athinathalwar for worship. in the ghoshties (group of worshipers in front of the deity) both on ordinary and special days the said jeers are shown honours befitting their rank. the honours consist of distribution of theertham, thulasi, satari and viniyogam, and a few more similar items. each of the said jeers is allotted a particular place in the ghoshti and a certain order of precedence is observed inter se between them. this order of precedence in the matter of receiving honours has become an unending source of bickering between the religious heads; with the result, the madras hindu religious endow ments board, constituted under act 1 of 1923, with jurisdiction to administer the endowments in the madras state, had to interfere and settle the disputes inter se between the various jeers. on may 12, 1927, the said board fixed the order of precedence for honours between the various jeers to be observed both on ordinary and special days. by the said order the board recognized the emberumanar jeer 's right 513 to the honours and perquisites in precedence over the other jeers on all the days other than vaikasi festival days, except the 7th day, and as regards the other days of the festival, namely, 1st to 6th and 8th to 10th days, the board directed that the other jeers should be shown on the respective days both the ordinary and special honours in precedence over the rest of the jeers, including the emberumanar jeer. not satisfied with the said order, the emberumanar jeer filed o. section no. 320 of 1933 in the court of the district munsif, tirunelveli, which was later transferred to the court of the subordinate judge, tuticorin, as o. section no.", "completion": "\" we may also add to the said facts that at one time the share of tasdik allowance to the emberumanar temple was paid through the trustee of athinathalwar temple and there was also an occasion when a trustee of the emberumanar temple was dismissed by the trustee of the athinathalwar temple.\non the other hand, both the temples are under different managements, they have their separate officeholders, distinct rituals, different budgets, and separate endowments;

and the learned district judge in a common judgment disposed of them on january 23, 1947. 515 the learned district judge, on a review of the evidence in the case, held that the institutions were not interdependent or intimately connected in such a way that an office holder of the emberumanar temple was necessarily an office holder of the athiiiathalwar temple. on that finding, he held that the plaintiff was not an office holder of the athinathalwar temple and, therefore, he was not entitled to file a suit with regard to his rights of precedence in being given the theertham, etc. in the result he allowed the appeals and dismissed both the suits with costs throughout. against the said judgment, the plaintiff preferred second appeals to the high court of judicature at madras, being second appeals nos. 2120 and 2121 of 1947. they were heard by krishnaswami nayudu, j., who on a reconsideration of the evidence disagreed with the finding arrived at by the learned district judge and accepted the finding given by the learned subordinate judge. not only the learned judge accepted the finding of the learned subordinate judge that the plaintiff as the aradanaikar or the archaka of the sub shrine was virtually an office holder in the main temple, he also went further and held that, as one of the theerthakars, the plaintiff could be considered to be the holder of the office of arulipad in the main temple. in the result the learned judge set aside the decree of the district judge and restored the decrees of the learned subordinate judge. as leave to appeal to a division bench was not given by the learned judge, the first defendant, i.e., the vanamamalai jeer, in the suits, by special leave, has preferred these appeals against the judgment of the high court. mr. a. v.", "completion": "the learned district munsif dismissed the suit on the ground that it was not maintainable as the plaintiff had no legal right in respect 514 of which he could seek relief in a civil court.\non appeal, the learned subordinate judge, tirunelveli, came to the conclusion that, as the plaintiff had come to court to establish his right of precedence to receive the theertham, etc., as forming part of the emoluments of his office of aradanaikar in the suit temple, the suit could not be dismissed on the preliminary ground that it was barked under section 9 of the code of civil procedure;

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: viswanatha sastri, learned counsel for the appellant, raised before us the following points: (1) a suit for a declaration that the plaintiff is entitled to honours in a temple would not lie unless he establishes that he holds an office in the said temple and that the said honours form part of the perquisites attached to the said office, and that, as in the present case the plaintiff claimed that he was an aradanaikar and trustee of only the emberumanar temple and as such entitled to honours in athinathalwar temple, 516 the suits should have been dismissed in limine on the ground that the plaints did not disclose any claim of civil nature falling under section 9 of the code of civil procedure. (2) the courts were not justified in allowing the plaintiff to make out a now case not disclosed in the plaints, namely that the emberumanar temple was a subordinate shrine of the athi nathalwar temple and, therefore, the plaintiff was the office holder of the latter temple; assuming that there was justification for the courts in allowing the plaintiff to develop a new case at a very late stage of the proceedings, there was a clear finding of the district court based on the evidence adduced in the case that the emberumanar temple was not a sub shrine of the athinathalwar temple, and the high court had no jurisdiction to set aside that finding in second appeals. mr. rajagopala sastri, learned counsel for the respondents, contended that the plaintiff 's alternative case was not really a new one, but all the relevant facts in support of that case were disclosed in the plaints, and that the finding of the district judge was not a finding of fact but was either a legal inference from proved facts or a mixed question of fact and law. he argued that the contention of learned counsel for the appellant ignores the religious background and ideas of the class of persons with which we are now concerned, and that, if the matter is approached from a correct perspective, as the high court did, it would be realized that there was such an association between the two temples as it could be said that one is subordinate to the other leading to the only irresistible inference that the plaintiff, the office holder of the sub shrine, could claim honours in the main temple of which the sub shrine is only a part in the larger sense. at the outset it would be convenient and necessary to notice briefly the law pertaining to the maintainability of suits in civil courts in respect of honours in temples. section 9 of the code of civil procedure describes the nature of suits which a court has jurisdiction to entertain. it can entertain every suit of a civil nature excepting suits of which its cognizance is 517 either expressly or impliedly barred. as a corollary to this, it follows that a court cannot entertain a suit which is not of a civil nature. prima facie suits raising questions of religious rites and ceremonies only are not maintainable in a civil court, for they do not deal with legal rights of parties. but the explanation to the section accepting the said undoubted position says that a suit in which the right to property or to an office is contested is a suit of civil nature notwithstanding that such right may depend entirely on the decision of a question as to religious rites or ceremonies. it implies two things, namely, (i) a suit for an office is a suit of a civil nature; and (ii) it does not cease to be one even if the said right depends entirely upon a decision of a question as to the religious rites or ceremonies. it implies further that questions as to religious rites or ceremonies cannot independently of such a right form the subject matter of a civil suit. honours shown or precedence given to religious dignitaries when they attend religious ceremonies in a tem ple cannot be placed on a higher footing than the religious rights or ceremonies, for they are integral part of the said rites or ceremonies in the sense that the said honours are shown to persons partaking in the ceremonies. prima facie honours, such as who is to stand in the ghoshti, in what place, who is to get the tulasi, etc., in which order, and similar others, cannot be considered to be part of the remuneration or perquisites attached to an office, for they are only tokens of welcome of an honoured guest within the precincts of a temple. one would have thought that it would even be a sacrilege to claim a right of precedence in the presence of the almighty god, for all go before him as humble devotees to earn his blessings and not to assert their self importance or claim their right to preferential treatment. but a century of case law in that part of the country has recognized certain rights of different grades of devotees and they and their innumerable followers began to cherish them or even to fight for them in criminal and civil courts. this court, therefore, does not propose to reconsider the 66 518 question of honours on first principles but only will resurvey the law on the subject with a view to ascertain, and if possible to clarify, the legal position. the earliest decision is that in striman sadagopa vs kristna tatachariyar (1).", "completion": "viswanatha sastri, learned counsel for the appellant, raised before us the following points: (1) a suit for a declaration that the plaintiff is entitled to honours in a temple would not lie unless he establishes that he holds an office in the said temple and that the said honours form part of the perquisites attached to the said office, and that, as in the present case the plaintiff claimed that he was an aradanaikar and trustee of only the emberumanar temple and as such entitled to honours in athinathalwar temple, 516 the suits should have been dismissed in limine on the ground that the plaints did not disclose any claim of civil nature falling under section 9 of the code of civil procedure.\nbut the explanation to the section accepting the said undoubted position says that a suit in which the right to property or to an office is contested is a suit of civil nature notwithstanding that such right may depend entirely on the decision of a question as to religious rites or ceremonies.\nit implies two things, namely, (i) a suit for an office is a suit of a civil nature;

and the alleged dues of his office have no doubt been owing to the great reverence at one time entertained for his sacredotal rank in the hindu religion, and the importance from a religious point of view of his mere presence at the pagoda.\" he concluded thus: \"such honours and emoluments cannot in any respect be considered as remuneration for duties or ministrations performed by the plaintiff in the secular affairs or religious services of the pagoda.\" (1) ,3o6. 519 this decision, which has stood the test of time, clearly lays down that a suit to enforce the rights of persons holding offices connected with the management and regulation of temples and for honours and emoluments connected therewith would lie in a civil court; but a suit by a plaintiff, who does not hold an office in the temple, claiming honours customarily shown to him as a matter of devotional respect and display due to his rank is not of a civil nature. the principle laid down in this case and restated in subsequent cases has been applied by a division bench of the madras high court to a claim for first theertham, etc., in sri rungachariar vs rungasami buttachar (1). that decision was given in an appeal arising out of a suit for a declaration that the plaintiffs had a hereditary miras right to the offices of sthalathar, kutumba first theertham, muntrapushpam, vedaparayanam and adyapakam from times immemorial in the temple of sri parimala ranga nathaswami at tiruvilandur, and, by virtue of such right, were entitled to a fourth share of the honours and emoluments due to their offices as detailed in schedule a of the plaint. the learned judges, on the evidence, came to the following conclusion: \". . the plaintiffs as hereditary sthalathars are bound to perform, besides the duties of superintendence attached to their office of sthalathar, the ceremonial duties of vedaparayanam, etc., and are entitled to receive remuneration for the performance of those duties. included in this remuneration is the privilege of first theertham ' from which the plaintiffs are called 'theerthakars\". then the learned judges proceeded to observe: \"taking the findings to be, as we do, that the privilege of the first theertham is attached to the hereditary office of the plaintiffs as a part of the remuneration of the office, the court must, to protect the plaintiffs in the enjoyment of the office, declare what is the honour to which they are entitled. \" this decision recognizes that a suit for a declaration of a plaintiff 's right to an office and for the honours, (1) mad.291, 208.520 such as first theertham, etc., as part of the remuneration will lie in a civil court. athan sadagopachariar swamigal vs elayavalli sri nivasachariar (1) is a decision relating to honours in athinathalwar temple itself. the plaintiff in that case was a trustee of a temple called pillalokacharyar 's temple. the principal object of the suit was to prevent the first defendant from claiming to be one of the adhyapaka mirasidars in the temple of nammalwar and adinathar in alwar tirunagari. it was contended that the first defendant was one of the seven adhyapaka mirasidars in the temple and his rank in the ghoshti was just above the plaintiffs. sadasiva aiyar, j., posed the question raised and gave his answer thereto thus: \"the legal question i wish to say something about is whether a suit for the honours mentioned in the second item of the 2nd schedule to the plaint is maintainable in a civil court. it is clear that if those honours are not attached to any office in the temple, no such suit could lie.", "completion": "519 this decision, which has stood the test of time, clearly lays down that a suit to enforce the rights of persons holding offices connected with the management and regulation of temples and for honours and emoluments connected therewith would lie in a civil court;

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: the first branch of the question, therefore, is a question of fact, viz., whether these honours are attached to the adhyapaka miras office in the temple.\" after considering the evidence and other relevant decisions, the learned judge came to the following conclusion: \"i see no difficulty whatever in holding on the evidence in this case that the plaintiffs and the 1st defendant and the 5 other adhyapaka mirasidars get their rank in the goshti and their rank in the distributions of prasadams not because those honours are part of the adhyapaka miras office to which they are entitled but because of their being acharya purushas or of their families having been very respectable religious families for long or because the mere respect due to their offices has been considered as making them fit in a social, and religious point of view to obtain such honours. \" that would be enough to dispose of that appeal, but the learned judge proceeded to make certain observations even on the assumption that the said honours (1) , 299, 300, 301. 521 had been attached to emoluments so far as the 7 adhyapaka mirasidars were concerned. the observations of the learned judge, though obiter, deserve to be quoted not only because of his vast experience in matters of hindu religion but also because of his well known reformative zeal to remove the cobwebs that shroded the hindu religion by superstitious ignorance and perverted imposition. the learned judge says: \". . the next question of law is whether such honours to be shown in the presence of god can be legally attached to the office as emoluments, in other words, can honours be legally claimed by anybody as receivable by him in a temple? when a trustee chooses to parade the temple elephants and dancing girls before a high official or any other person and gives him prasadams, etc., he does it in order to show 'honours ' to that person and when he does it without prejudice to the conduct of the rituals and ceremonies in the temple, he always says that the god of the temple himself condescends to treat the official or other persons as god 's guest and shows him these 'honours '. such persons to whom respect is shown cannot in my opinion claim such 'honours ' as a legal right, but as a favour shown by the temple deity. such honours in the strict eye of the shastras cannot be called honours at all but as doles condescendingly given by the temple deity as a 'favour '. one of the honours, as is well known, shown to a, hindu in a vaishnava temple is to place the impression of the feet of the deity upon the head or shoulders of the devotee. another is the distribution of the 'leavings ' of the food offered to the deity to the distinguished devotee. the sandal paste of the feet of the deity and the leaving of his food and the garland worn by the god are given as marks of pure grace and not as rights and hoilours claimable by the devotee. . this clearly shows that while we ought to humbly accept the deity 's leavings given through the trustee or an archaka, a claim for 'honour ' to be shown in the presence of god is a sinful claim and is illegal and unshastraic. i would therefore respectfully confine the decision in sri bungachariar vs bungaswami buttachar(1) to cases in which the receiving of the first theertham by an office holder has become indissoluble part of the ritual to b e performed by the recipient as an office holder and the extension of the principle should be carefully guarded against. these are weighty observations and if they were appropriate in the year 1913 they should be much more so in the year 1961.\" we respectfully accept these observations as laying down the correct proposition, namely, that a party claiming an honour like first theertham, etc., has to prove not only that he is an office holder of the temple and that he has been receiving the first theertham in the ghoshti but also that the receipt of the first theertham, has become an integral part of the ritual to be performed by him as an officeholder; for, the receipt of the first theertham would be consistent with its being shown as a grace from the lord and also as its being a part of the remuneration to the office. another division bench of the madras high court in vathiar venkatachariar vs p. ponappa ayyengar (2) had to consider the question of a claim to a religious honour which consisted of receiving theerthams and prasadams in the temple in certain order of precedence. this case also relates to athinathalwar temple and to the question of precedence among the theerthakars. the first question raised was whether there was such an office as theertham office in the temple. krishnan, j., delivering the leading judgment, in rejecting that there was such an office observed: \"it may be mentioned that among the theer thakars there are some 5 or 7 in number, who are called adhyapakamdars, whose special duty it is to recite these prabandams and they are remunerated by inam lands given to them. they are what may be called the official reciters in this temple.\" adverting to the question raised, the learned judge proceeded to observe: \"it is clear that, to constitute an office one, if not (1) mad, 291, 298.", "completion": "the first branch of the question, therefore, is a question of fact, viz., whether these honours are attached to the adhyapaka miras office in the temple.\" after considering the evidence and other relevant decisions, the learned judge came to the following conclusion: \"i see no difficulty whatever in holding on the evidence in this case that the plaintiffs and the 1st defendant and the 5 other adhyapaka mirasidars get their rank in the goshti and their rank in the distributions of prasadams not because those honours are part of the adhyapaka miras office to which they are entitled but because of their being acharya purushas or of their families having been very respectable religious families for long or because the mere respect due to their offices has been considered as making them fit in a social, and religious point of view to obtain such honours.\n. the next question of law is whether such honours to be shown in the presence of god can be legally attached to the office as emoluments, in other words, can honours be legally claimed by anybody as receivable by him in a temple?\nthese are weighty observations and if they were appropriate in the year 1913 they should be much more so in the year 1961.\" we respectfully accept these observations as laying down the correct proposition, namely, that a party claiming an honour like first theertham, etc., has to prove not only that he is an office holder of the temple and that he has been receiving the first theertham in the ghoshti but also that the receipt of the first theertham, has become an integral part of the ritual to be performed by him as an officeholder;

but it is a question of fact to be ascertained on the evidence whether the said honours are attached to the office as part of its per quisites in the sense that they have become an integral part of the ritual to be performed by the recipient as the office holder or are only shown to him as a mark of respect on the occasion of his visit to the temple. having regard to the said principles, lot us now look at the contentions raised in this case. the first submission of learned counsel for the appellant is that, in view of the said principles, the suit should have been dismissed in limine on the basis of the allegations in the plaint. in paragraph 4 of the plaint in o. section no. 45 of 1945, the claim of the plaintiff to the office is stated thus: \"the plaintiff is the present emberumanar jeer and as such the aradhanaikar and trustee of the said 67 526 emberuraanar temple having been appointed and nominated by his predecessor sri sadagopa ramanuja jeer who died in 1930. \" in paragraph 7 of the plaint, his claim to the honours is stated thus: \"in his capacity as holder of the office of aradhanaikar and trustee of the emberumanar temple and as emoluments attached to the said office, the emberumanar jeer is by immemorial usage and custom entitled to receive, in the ghoshties that are formed before all the sannidhies in the adhinathalwar temple on all occasions of each day on all the days of the year without exception, the first theertham and other honours described in schedule 1 below and the perquisites described in schedule 11 below.\" in paragraph 9 it is further stated: \"in his capacity as holder of the office of aradhanalkar and trustee of emberumanar temple and as emoluments attached to the said office the emberumanar jeer is entitled to receive on the 7th day of vaikasi festival in the athinathalwar temple, in addition to and along with the honours and perquisites described in schedules 1 and 11, certain other honours such as the tying of the silk gear, etc., more particularly described in schedule iii hereto. these are known as special honours while the honours described in schedules i and ii are known as ordinary honours.\" it is clear from the said allegations that the claim of the plaintiff to the ordinary and special honours in the athinathalwar temple is based upon his capacity as office holder as aradhanaikar and trustee of emberu manar temple. there is no allegation that he is an officeholder in athinathalwar temple. in the written statements filed by the defendants the claim of the plaintiff to the said honours is denied. in o.s. no. 46 of 1945 also the claim of the plaintiff to the honours is based upon the same allegations that are made in the plaint in o. section no. 45 of 1945. in the written statement filed by the defendants the said claim is denied. indeed, the original issues reflected 527 only the allegations found in the pleadings. if the courts had directed their minds to the pleadings, as they should have done, instead of traveling beyond them in search of some plausible basis to sustain the plaintiff 's claim the suits would have been dismissed for the simple reason that on the allegations in the plaint the plaintiff was not an office holder in the temple of athinathalwar and, therefore, he ' could not claim the honours shown to him in the said temple as perquisites attached to his office; but unfortunately this was not done, and we think that it is too late to dismiss the suit on that ground when all the parties adduced voluminous evidence on the alternative ground and took the decision of the courts. we shall, therefore, pro ceed to consider the case on the alternative basis on which the claim has been put forward on behalf of the plaintiff in the courts below. to appreciate the said basis, it is necessary to re capitulate the relevant facts. originally, the district munsif dismissed the suit o. section no. 320 of 1933 (0. section no. 45 of 1945 on the file of the court of the subordinate judge, tuticorin) on the ground that the plaintiff has no legal right in respect of which he could seek relief in a civil court. but on appeal the learned subordinate judge set aside the decree and remanded the suit for trial. in paragraph 18 of his judgment, the learned subordinate judge stated: \"in view of the above authorities i am of opinion that when the present plaintiff has come to court with a specific case set out in paragraphs 7 and 9 of his plaint that his right of precedence to receive theertham, thulasi, satari, prasadam and other per quisites forms part of the emoluments of his office of aradanaikar in the suit temple, the suit cannot be dismissed on the preliminary ground that it is barred under section 9, civil procedure code. there is an obvious mistake in this statement, for in the paragraphs mentioned therein it is not alleged that the plaintiff has an office in the athinathalwar temple.\" presumably this mistake lead the learned judge to come to the conclusion which he did. on appeal, in the high court it was pointed out to the court that 528 temple.", "completion": "\" in paragraph 7 of the plaint, his claim to the honours is stated thus: \"in his capacity as holder of the office of aradhanaikar and trustee of the emberumanar temple and as emoluments attached to the said office, the emberumanar jeer is by immemorial usage and custom entitled to receive, in the ghoshties that are formed before all the sannidhies in the adhinathalwar temple on all occasions of each day on all the days of the year without exception, the first theertham and other honours described in schedule 1 below and the perquisites described in schedule 11 below.\" in paragraph 9 it is further stated: \"in his capacity as holder of the office of aradhanalkar and trustee of emberumanar temple and as emoluments attached to the said office the emberumanar jeer is entitled to receive on the 7th day of vaikasi festival in the athinathalwar temple, in addition to and along with the honours and perquisites described in schedules 1 and 11, certain other honours such as the tying of the silk gear, etc., more particularly described in schedule iii hereto.\nthese are known as special honours while the honours described in schedules i and ii are known as ordinary honours.\" it is clear from the said allegations that the claim of the plaintiff to the ordinary and special honours in the athinathalwar temple is based upon his capacity as office holder as aradhanaikar and trustee of emberu manar temple.\n46 of 1945 also the claim of the plaintiff to the honours is based upon the same allegations that are made in the plaint in o.\nif the courts had directed their minds to the pleadings, as they should have done, instead of traveling beyond them in search of some plausible basis to sustain the plaintiff 's claim the suits would have been dismissed for the simple reason that on the allegations in the plaint the plaintiff was not an office holder in the temple of athinathalwar and, therefore, he ' could not claim the honours shown to him in the said temple as perquisites attached to his office;

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: but chandrasekara aiyar, j., for the first time, allowed the plaintiff to make out a new case. the learned judge stated the said case in the following words: \"one view to take up in this case is what was adopted by the district munsif, namely, that as the plaintiff admittedly holds no office in the athinathalwar temple he cannot claim these honours. the other view which found favour with the subordinate judge is that owing to the alleged associations of the two temples, their interlinking and their interdependence, the aradanaikar and trustee of the emberumanar temple might claim to be regarded as an office holder in the athinathalwar temple.\" the learned judge did not decide the point, but he observed: \"but the idea of two temples or mutts, of equal rank and co ordinate and independent authority or where one is the primary institution and the other its subsidiary or adjunct being linked together for certain purposes of worship and observance of rituals cannot be said to be entirely foreign to hindu notions.\" he concluded thus: \"of course, before he can succeed in the suit, the plaintiff has to make out that he being the aradanaikar and trustee of the emberumanar temple amounts to his holding an office in the suit temple.\" the question whether the origin of this new case is found in the judgment of the subordinate judge or that of chandrasekara aiyar, j., need not detain us. this is a new case not disclosed in the plaint; but after remand both the parties directed their attention to this question and adduced all the relevant evidence pertaining thereto. on remand, the learned subordinate judge in an elaborate judgment considered the said aspect of the case. he considered the evidence under three heads, namely, (i) historical, (ii) administrative, and (iii) financial. on the first head after considering the origin of the two temples, the learned judge came to the 529 conclusion that the idea that the emberumanar temple was historically connected with athinathalwar temple could not be \"poopoohed\". under the administrative head, he found that till 1926 emberumanar temple was merely a sub shrine attached to the bigger athinathalwar temple, and the trustees of the latter temple were exercising administrative control over it as such. coming then to the financial side, he found that there was sufficient evidence to justify the inference that the two were intimately connected even financially. passing on to the question of ceremonial and religious association between these two temples, the learned judge found that there was similarity in the mode of routine and day to day worship in the two temples; but there was no interlinking or interdependence between them in that matter. then the learned subordinate judge pointed out that notwithstanding that there was no interlinking and interdependence in that matter, they were so intimately associated with each other in other religious rites and ceremonies as to lead to the inference that the emberumanar temple was after all only a sub shrine attached to the main temple of athinathalwar. then he pointed out that the question in the said form was not before chandrasekara aiyar, j., but thought that it was open to him to go into the said question. after going into the evidence, he finally came to the conclusion that apart from historical and secular association, there had been also ceremonial and religious association between the two temples and, therefore, the emberumanar temple was nothing but a sub shrine attached to the main temple of athinathalwar. on that finding he further held that the plaintiff who was admittedly the aradhanaikar of the said temple was virtually an office holder in the main temple. in the appeals filed by the various parties against the decrees of the learned subordinate judge, the learned district judge of tirunelveli reviewed the evidence once again under the said three heads and came to a contrary conclusion. on the administrative side he found that the emberumanar temple was not subordinate to the 530 temple of athinathalwar, in the sense that the authorities of the latter temple could give orders to the authorities of the emberumanar temple, that is, the former was not subordinate to the latter temple administratively. on the financial side, he was equally emphatic that the two institutions were not interdependent. on the religious or ritual aspect, the learned district judge held that, as both the institutions were constructed in the same place, there must have been some connection between the two and in that sense in a general way the emberumanar temple might be described as a sub shrine. on the said facts, the learned judge posed the following question for his consideration: \"what is the inference to be derived? on the evidence, he answered the question thus: \"i hold on the evidence that these institutions are not interdependent or intimately connected in such a way that an office holder of emberumanar temple is necessarily an office holder of the athi nathalwar temple. i hold therefore that the plaintiff is not an office holder of the athinathalwar temple and therefore he is not entitled to file a suit with regard to his rights of precedence in being given theertham.\" this finding is certainly a finding of fact based upon the entire evidence in the case.", "completion": "the learned judge stated the said case in the following words: \"one view to take up in this case is what was adopted by the district munsif, namely, that as the plaintiff admittedly holds no office in the athinathalwar temple he cannot claim these honours.\nthe other view which found favour with the subordinate judge is that owing to the alleged associations of the two temples, their interlinking and their interdependence, the aradanaikar and trustee of the emberumanar temple might claim to be regarded as an office holder in the athinathalwar temple.\" the learned judge did not decide the point, but he observed: \"but the idea of two temples or mutts, of equal rank and co ordinate and independent authority or where one is the primary institution and the other its subsidiary or adjunct being linked together for certain purposes of worship and observance of rituals cannot be said to be entirely foreign to hindu notions.\" he concluded thus: \"of course, before he can succeed in the suit, the plaintiff has to make out that he being the aradanaikar and trustee of the emberumanar temple amounts to his holding an office in the suit temple.\" the question whether the origin of this new case is found in the judgment of the subordinate judge or that of chandrasekara aiyar, j., need not detain us.\non the first head after considering the origin of the two temples, the learned judge came to the 529 conclusion that the idea that the emberumanar temple was historically connected with athinathalwar temple could not be \"poopoohed\".\nthen the learned subordinate judge pointed out that notwithstanding that there was no interlinking and interdependence in that matter, they were so intimately associated with each other in other religious rites and ceremonies as to lead to the inference that the emberumanar temple was after all only a sub shrine attached to the main temple of athinathalwar."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: in the second appeal, the learned judge of the high court, on a review of the evidence, disagreed with the learned district judge and accepted the finding of the learned subordinate judge, and held, for similar reasons, that the plaintiff was virtually an office holder in the main temple; he further held that the plaintiff could also be considered to be the holder of the office of arulipad and, in that capacity also he was entitled to the first theertham and other honours. the first question is one of fact. the learned district judge, though he differed from the subordinate judge, held, on a consideration of the entire evidence that the plaintiff was not an office holder in the athinathalwar temple. it has now been well settled that the high court has no jurisdiction to entertain a second appeal on the ground of erroneous finding of 531 fact however gross the error may seem to be. the judgment of the learned judge does not disclose that there are any permissible grounds for interference with the finding of the district judge. the second ground of decision of the high court is based upon a case that was raised for the first time before it. nowhere in the plaints or before the two subordinate courts the plaintiff attempted to sustain his claim on his being the holder of the office of arulipad. the high court, therefore, was not justified in allowing the plaintiff to set out any such claim for the first time in the second appeal. that apart, it does not appear that there is an office called arulipad. a division bench of the madras high court in vathiar venkatachariar vs p. ponnappa ayyengar (1) had an occasion to define the word \"arulipad\". there, a claim was made to the office of theerthakar. on the evidence it was held that the plaintiffs had not made out the existence of any obligatory duty on the part of theerthakar in the temple. in that context krishnan, j., observed thus: \". . . the theerthakars have special places allotted to them in the temple, to stand and recite and they are given the honour of thertham and prasadam, before the outsiders get them; and they have what is called an \"arulipad\", that is, their names are called out by the archaka in a certain order, when, if present, they have to respond by saying 'nayinde ', meaning 'i am here '.\" it is, therefore, clear that there is no office designated as \" arulipad\", but that word only describes the duty of the archaka to call their names to ascertain whether the theerthakars are present in the ghoshti. there is no evidence in this case that the plaintiff, as a theerthakar, has any obligatory duty in the athinathalwar temple to perform and, therefore, it is not possible to treat him as an office holder in that capacity in the said temple. this leads us to the argument of the counsel for the respondent that, though it cannot be said that the emberumanar temple is a part or a subordinate of the athinathalwar temple in the sense that all the (1) 532 office holders of the former are the office holders of the latter, there is sufficient ritual connection between the two which in the consciousness of the religious public is treated as sufficiently intimate to make the one subordinate to the other. this intimate religious connection, the argument proceeds, flows from the historical, administrative and financial ties, however loose they may be, that have existed for over a century between the said two temples. this argument may have some validity in a theological discussion or an ecclesiastical court, but cannot obviously be accepted in a civil court. krishnaswami nayudu, j., sum marizes the facts in his judgment which, in his view, support the conclusion that the emberumanar jeer was virtually an office holder in the athinathalwar temple. as the correctness of the said facts is not questioned before us, it will be convenient to extract them in the words of the learned judge: \"in all vaishnavite temples, the alwars and the acharyas take a prominent place in the religious ceremonies and observances of the temple. an attempt was made to show that there has been an interlinking and interdependence of the ritual and ceremonies between these two temples, but, as rightly found by the learned subordinate judge, in the matter of routine and day to day worship and rituals such interlinking and interdependence have not been satisfactorily made out. the rituals or the manner of performing divine service are uniform in every vaishnavite temple. but, as found by the learned subordinate judge, though a ritual in the main temple is not dependent upon the ritual in the sub shrine, the emberumanar deity being an acharya is intimately associated with the deity in the main temple in all the important festivals, the most important of which are the margali and vaikasi festivals and other religious ceremonies. there are several mandagapadis for the athinatha alwar in the emberumanar temple. there is sethu thirumanjam for the athinatha alwar and embe rumanar deities on three occasions, two of them in the emberumanar temple and one in the main 533 temple. then there is what is called alwar sayanam which has to take place on the 10th day of the margali festival and which is performed in the main temple. there are several other similar religious observances, where the two deities meet and certain rituals and religious ceremonies are gone through.", "completion": "in the second appeal, the learned judge of the high court, on a review of the evidence, disagreed with the learned district judge and accepted the finding of the learned subordinate judge, and held, for similar reasons, that the plaintiff was virtually an office holder in the main temple;

respondents were justified in (a) levying customs duties on the goods imported by the petitioner and (b) imposing a penalty on them for effecting these imports. we shall now briefly narrate the facts necessary to understand the points arising for decision. the petitioners who are citizens of india placed an order on august 6, 1954, with certain firms in the united kingdom for the despatch of cycles and cycle parts to pondicherry which was at that date the principal french establishment in india. according to the law which then obtained in pondicherry territory, merchants desiring to do business there had to have \"a patent\" or licence from the authorities for carrying on such business. the petitioners applied for such a \"patent\" to the authorities on august 14, 1954, and they were granted one on august 18, which was to be effective from august 1, 1954. the order placed with u. k. firms was accepted and the goods covered by the indents were shipped from the u. k. ports on 413 october 11, 1954. the foreign exchange needed for effecting this import could under the french law have been obtained either from or on the authorization of the head of the department of economic affairs at pondicherry or by what has been termed purchase in the open market. in pursuance of these facilities the moneys required were transmitted through bankers who made payments on behalf of the petitioners in the united kingdom and the goods arrived in pondicherry on december 4, 1954, the bill of entry being presented to the customs authorities for clearance on the 17th of that month. meanwhile, political changes took place in the governance of pondicherry and other french settlements. an agreement was entered into between the governments of the union of india and of france under which the administration of the french settlements, including pondicherry, was ceded to the union government. this agreement which was signed on behalf of the two governments on october 21, 1954, was to be effective from november 1, 1954. on october 30, 1954, two notifications were issued by the ministry of external affairs in pursuance of the agreement dated october 21, 1954, between the two governments. they were respectively s.r.o. 3314 and s.r.o. 3315. as the questions arising for decision in the petition turn on the proper construction and legal effect of these two notifications, it would be necessary to deal with them in some detail, but for the purpose of the narration of facts, it would be sufficient to say that while s.r.o. 3314 saved the operation of the pre existing french law except in so far as it had been affected by s.r.o. 3315, the latter repealed such laws to the extent they were inconsistent with the indian enactments set out in the schedule whose operation was extended to pondicherry and the french settlements. among the indian enactments so applied to pondicherry were the foreign exchange regulation act, 1947, the import and export (control) act, 1947, the , and the tariff act, 1934. 53 414 the bill of entry was, as stated earlier, presented to the customs authorities at pondicherry on december 17, 1954, and it would be seen that by that date pondicherry was being administered as part of the union territory with the indian laws referred to operating in the area. the customs authorities at pondicherry took the view that as the, consignment imported by the petitioners did not reach the port of pondicherry before november 1, 1954, when the union government took over the territory, the importation was without authorization of the indian law and therefore in contravention of the import and export control act and the orders issued therein, the , the tariff act and the provisions of other relevant enactments. after a notice to the

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: this court held that the words \"things done\" in paragraph 6 of s.r.o. 3315 were comprehensive so as to include a contract effected before november 1, 1954, though its legal effect and consequence projected into the post transfer period and the goods were imported only after november 1, 1954. the petitioners then before the court having authority under the french law which prevailed before november 1, 1954, to import the goods and having placed the orders and effected the imports in pursuance of that law, this court held that the imported goods could not, notwithstanding that they were actually brought into the territory after november 1, 1954, be confiscated on the ground that they were imported without a licence required under the imports and exports (control) act and the sea cus toms act. mr. sen learned counsel for the respondent urged some points of distinction between the facts in the universal imports agency 's case( ') and the case now before us, but having examined them we find there is no substance in the argument. learned counsel submitted that in the present case the import was effected not by opening letters of credit but by payment by bankers ' draft and secondly, that the foreign exchange required for payment to the u. k. supplier was met in the present case by open market purchases and not by the purchase of foreign exchange from french banking establishments. in our opinion, these are wholly immaterial. learned counsel had to admit that there was no legal requirement to have a (1) ; 418 letter of credit and also that it was not in contravention of french law which prevailed before november 1, 1954, to obtain foreign exchange requirements by what are termed \"open market purchases\". in fact, in the case of the universal imports agency( ') the orders impugned were passed and were sought to 'be supported before this court on the ground that the foreign exchange requirements were met by \"open market purchases\" and that in consequence the importation was not authorized by the french law, and this contention was expressly negatived. we therefore hold that the petitioners are entitled to relief so far as the petition relates to the quashing of the order imposing the penalty and for a direction to refund the same. we now proceed to examine whether the claim of the petitioners that they are entitled to import the goods without payment of duty is justified by the saving contained in the last words of paragraph 6 of s.r.o. 3315. mr. chatterjee learned counsel for the petitioners had to admit that this matter was not the subject of decision in univeral imports agency '8 case (1). nor is it a matter for surprise that it was not, because the petitioners then before this court had never objected to the payment of the duty, and indeed the request they made to the customs authorities and which was rejected, which led to the petition, was that the authorisation which they had under the french law should be re validated by the indian customs authorities so as to permit the importation on payment of normal duty as if the same were licensed under the import and export (control) order; and that on payment of the duty they were entitled to a customs clearance under sections 87 and 89 of the . this being the nature of the controversy raised in this court, the petitioners relied on article 17 of the articles of agreement between the two governments, to which we shall advert later, in support of their submission that while the indian authorities were entitled to levy such customs duties as were fixed under law for the several articles imported, the import (1) ; 419 itself should be treated as authorised by the previous law whose operation was continued by the last words of cl. 6 of s.r.o. 3315 of 1954. further, as we shall presently show, there are passages in the judgment of subba rao, j., who spoke for the majority, that on an importation effected after november 1, 1954, customs duty would have to be paid according to the rates fixed under the relevant indian legislation. the submission of mr. chatterji however was that this relief which he claimed followed logically from the reasoning of subba rao, j., and in particular he relied on the following passage: \". . a purchase by import involved a series of integrated activities commencing from the contract of purchase with a foreign firm and ending with the bringing of the goods into the importing country and the purchase and resultant import formed parts of a same transaction. if so, in the present case the bringing of the goods into india and the relevant contracts entered into by the petitioners, with the foreign dealers formed parts of the same transaction. the imports, therefore, were the effect or the legal consequence of the 'things done ', i. e., the contracts entered into by the petitioners with the foreign dealers before merger. \" the argument of the learned counsel based on this passage was on the following lines: this court has held that it is the agreement concluded with the foreign seller under which goods are contracted to be imported, which constituted the \"thing done\". the legal consequence of that \"thing done\" was the act of importation, because that was the object and purpose of the contract, so far as the buyer was concerned. this court has held that the previous authorization by the french law, as it were, projected into the post transfer period so as to justify the importer claiming that the importation was authorized and this is the ratio of the decision.", "completion": "this court held that the words \"things done\" in paragraph 6 of s.r.o. 3315 were comprehensive so as to include a contract effected before november 1, 1954, though its legal effect and consequence projected into the post transfer period and the goods were imported only after november 1, 1954.\nthe petitioners then before the court having authority under the french law which prevailed before november 1, 1954, to import the goods and having placed the orders and effected the imports in pursuance of that law, this court held that the imported goods could not, notwithstanding that they were actually brought into the territory after november 1, 1954, be confiscated on the ground that they were imported without a licence required under the imports and exports (control) act and the sea cus toms act.\nin fact, in the case of the universal imports agency( ') the orders impugned were passed and were sought to 'be supported before this court on the ground that the foreign exchange requirements were met by \"open market purchases\" and that in consequence the importation was not authorized by the french law, and this contention was expressly negatived.\nnor is it a matter for surprise that it was not, because the petitioners then before this court had never objected to the payment of the duty, and indeed the request they made to the customs authorities and which was rejected, which led to the petition, was that the authorisation which they had under the french law should be re validated by the indian customs authorities so as to permit the importation on payment of normal duty as if the same were licensed under the import and export (control) order;

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: but this does not, learned counsel urged, exhaust the entirety of the rights of the importer. the previous french law authorized the import into a territory which was \"a free port\". when therefore the importation was made by virtue 420 of the authorization contained in the previous law, its effect should extend not merely to justify the claim to have the import treated as one authorized under the relevant indian law, but logically also as entitling the party to effect the importation without payment of customs duty. we find ourselves unable to accept this argument. the expression \"free port\" in the case of pondicherry merely meant freedom from restriction as to importation in the shape of licence, etc., and not a complete absence of duties leviable on importation. but that apart, if the submission of the learned counsel amounted to saying that the point about the exemption of the petitioner from payment of customs duty is also covered by the decision of this court in universal imports agency 's case (1), we consider it wholly unjustified. as we have already shown, the liability to pay customs duty was admitted by the petitioner and the reasoning by which he sought relief in this court proceeded on the basis that such duties were exigible. besides, the entire reasoning of subba rao, j., was directed to show that the authorization under the french law to effect the import should be held to protect the petitioners then before the court from being treated as having imported goods without a licence under the import and export (control) act, and that is why in the penultimate paragraph of the order the conclusion reached is thus set down: \"we would therefore hold that paragraph 6 of the order saves the transaction entered into by the petitioners and that the respondents had no rights to confiscate their goods on the ground that they were imported without licence. \" it is in this context that the observations extracted earlier on which mr. chatterji relies have to be understood. besides, there are passages in the judgment which expressly refer to the fact that goods imported after november 1, 1954, would be liable to be charged duty under the relevant indian fiscal statute. in making this observation we have in mind the reference by the learned judge to the notification (1) ; 421 of the central government dated november 1, 1954, and to the terms of article 17 of the articles of agreement dated october 21, 1954, between the two governments (to both of which we shall advert later). the decision of this court is not, therefore, an authority to support the petitioner on the point regarding the right to import without payment of duty and we have to deal with the matter on the footing that it is res integra. nor can the plea based on the logic of the ratio of the decision in the universal imports agency 's case (1) assist mr. chatterji to any material extent, because the content of the saving as respects \"things done\", must ultimately be determined not by any interpretation of these two words in vacuo, but in the context of the entire scheme of the two section r. os. read in the light of other material which could assist in arriving at their scope. thus, for instance, if s.r.o. 3315 contained a specific proviso excepting from the saving as regards ' things done\" the obligation, say, to pay duties of customs, it could hardly be contended that as the imports under pre transfer contracts should be deemed to be authorised even if the goods arrive subsequent thereto, they should be exempt from the payment of duty. no doubt there is no such express provision but such a situation can also arise by necessary intendment. the right to exemption from payment of duty claimed by the petitioners would therefore have to depend on the proper interpretation of the relevant notifications, because as already seen as the and the tariff act, etc., having been extended to pondicherry territory, etc., from and after november 1, 1954, prima facie duty would be payable on the import. we have already pointed out the inter relation between s.r.o. 3314 and 3315 which were issued on the same date and by virtue of the same provisions and power. paragraph 6 of s.r.o. 3314 which provided for the continuance of the previous existing laws ran: (1) ; 54 422 \"all taxes, duties, cesses or fees which, immediately before the commencement of this order were being lawfully levied in the french establishments or any part thereof shall, in so far as such levy has not been discontinued by any of the laws extended to the french establishments by the french establishments (application of laws) order, 1954, continue to be levied and applied for the same purpose until other provisions are made by a competent legislature or authority\". this would be some indication that taxes, duties, cesses and fees imposed by reason of the extension to that territory, of indian laws under the french establishments (application of laws) order, 1954, (s.r.o. 3315) would be operative from and after november 1, 1954. on november 1, 1954, the government of india appointed a controller of imports and exports for the french establishments and paragraph 4 of that notification also contained the following: \" as regards orders placed outside the establishments and finalised through the grant of licence by the competent french authorities in accordance with the laws and regulations in force prior to 1st november, 1954, licence holders are advised to apply to the controller of imports and exports for validation of licences held by them. no fees will be charged for these applications\".", "completion": "when therefore the importation was made by virtue 420 of the authorization contained in the previous law, its effect should extend not merely to justify the claim to have the import treated as one authorized under the relevant indian law, but logically also as entitling the party to effect the importation without payment of customs duty.\nbut that apart, if the submission of the learned counsel amounted to saying that the point about the exemption of the petitioner from payment of customs duty is also covered by the decision of this court in universal imports agency 's case (1), we consider it wholly unjustified.\nbesides, the entire reasoning of subba rao, j., was directed to show that the authorization under the french law to effect the import should be held to protect the petitioners then before the court from being treated as having imported goods without a licence under the import and export (control) act, and that is why in the penultimate paragraph of the order the conclusion reached is thus set down: \"we would therefore hold that paragraph 6 of the order saves the transaction entered into by the petitioners and that the respondents had no rights to confiscate their goods on the ground that they were imported without licence.\nthe right to exemption from payment of duty claimed by the petitioners would therefore have to depend on the proper interpretation of the relevant notifications, because as already seen as the and the tariff act, etc., having been extended to pondicherry territory, etc., from and after november 1, 1954, prima facie duty would be payable on the import.\nparagraph 6 of s.r.o. 3314 which provided for the continuance of the previous existing laws ran: (1) ;

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: this notification, though it has no statutory force, was obviously part and parcel of s.r.o. 3314 and 3315, in so far as these related to the administration of the import and export (control) act, the and the tariff act and would therefore throw considerable light on what was intended by the framers of s.r.o. 3315. the effect of this notification was that the authorization granted by or the permission acquired from the french authorities was made to serve the same purpose as the grant of a licence to import under the import and export (control) act and nothing more. if its effect was in terms confined to this, there could be no contention that goods imported in pursuance of the authorization should be exempted from customs duty. 423 besides this, we might also draw attention to paragraph 17 of the articles of agreement dated october 21, 1954, under the terms of which the transfer of pondicherry to the union government was effected. no doubt, that was an agreement between two governments whose terms and covenants are not justiciable in municipal courts but as the two s.r.0s. themselves proceed on the basis of this agreement and have been issued by virtue of the authority acquired by the union government under the agreement, a reference to the terms thereof would be pertinent for understanding the scope or intent of the provisions in these two orders s.r.o. 3314 and 3315. paragraph 17 of the agreement dated october 21, 1954 which has been referred to also by subba rao, j., in the universal lmports agency 's case (1) in support of the position that the authorization under the french law to effect importation of goods into pondicherry was tanta mount to and had the same effect as the obtaining of a licence under the import and export (control) act, 1947 expressly made provision for the government of india applying to the establishment the relevant indian laws relating to the imposition of customs and other duties in respect of goods which entered the port after november 1, 1954. it reads: \" all orders placed outside the establishments and finalised through the grant of a licence by competent authorities in accordance with the laws and regulations in force, prior to the date of the de facto transfer, shall be fulfilled and the necessary foreign currency granted, as far as the goods are imported within the period of validity of the relevant licence. the goods shall, however, be liable to customs duty and other taxes normally leviable at indian ports. . . . . as we have already pointed out, this is exactly what is sought to be achieved by the conjoint operation of paragraph 6 of s.r.o. 3314 and the extension of fiscal laws to pondicherry effected by paragraph 3 of s.r.o. 3315. it is precisely this that is also brought out by paragraph 4 of the notification dated november 1, 1954, extracted earlier. in the circumstances (1) ; 424 it looks somewhat curious that the petitioners now before us, who as interveners in the petitions by the universal imports agency, etc., supported the invoking of para. 6 of s.r.o. 3314, or article 17 of the articles of agreement and para. 4 of the notification dated november 1, 1954, as an aid to the construction of the words \"things done\" in para. 6 of s.r.o. 3315 the government resisting their use as an aid, should now take up the position that these materials are irrelevant for determining the scope of those crucial words. in our opinion the petitioners are not entitled to have their goods imported into pondicherry after november 1, 1954, without payment of duty notwithstanding that the contracts, by reason of which the goods were imported, were entered into or the shipment took place before that date. the result is that the petition is allowed and the orders of the government, of the central board of revenue and the collector of customs are quashed only in so far as they impose a penalty on the petitioner for importing goods without a licence under the import and export (control) act, 1947, and the import control order. the respondents were entitled to demand and to enforce the payment of customs duty and the relief prayed in the petition in so far as it relates to the quashing of the order in that respect and the refund of the duty collected, fails and is rejected. in the circumstances there would be no order as to costs. das gupta, j. we agree that in view of this court 's decision in m/s. universal imports agency vs the chief controller of imports and exports (1) the petitioners are entitled to relief as against the order imposing penalty for importation of goods into pondicherry, even though the actual importation took place, after november 1, 1954, as the contract in pursuance of which the importation took place had been concluded prior to that date. we are not able to agree however that the position is different as regards the (1) [1061] 1 s.c.r. 305. 425 petitioners ' prayer for relief against the levy of customs duty on this very importation. with great respect to our learned brethren, who have taken the contrary view, we are of opinion that as long as the universal imports agency case (1) is not held to have been wrongly decided, we are bound by the authority of that decision to hold that the petitioners are entitled to relief against the levy of customs duty as well.", "completion": "paragraph 17 of the agreement dated october 21, 1954 which has been referred to also by subba rao, j., in the universal lmports agency 's case (1) in support of the position that the authorization under the french law to effect importation of goods into pondicherry was tanta mount to and had the same effect as the obtaining of a licence under the import and export (control) act, 1947 expressly made provision for the government of india applying to the establishment the relevant indian laws relating to the imposition of customs and other duties in respect of goods which entered the port after november 1, 1954.\nin our opinion the petitioners are not entitled to have their goods imported into pondicherry after november 1, 1954, without payment of duty notwithstanding that the contracts, by reason of which the goods were imported, were entered into or the shipment took place before that date.\nthe result is that the petition is allowed and the orders of the government, of the central board of revenue and the collector of customs are quashed only in so far as they impose a penalty on the petitioner for importing goods without a licence under the import and export (control) act, 1947, and the import control order.\nuniversal imports agency vs the chief controller of imports and exports (1) the petitioners are entitled to relief as against the order imposing penalty for importation of goods into pondicherry, even though the actual importation took place, after november 1, 1954, as the contract in pursuance of which the importation took place had been concluded prior to that date.\nwith great respect to our learned brethren, who have taken the contrary view, we are of opinion that as long as the universal imports agency case (1) is not held to have been wrongly decided, we are bound by the authority of that decision to hold that the petitioners are entitled to relief against the levy of customs duty as well."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: in all the three petitions which were before the court in the universal imports agency case, the petitioners had entered into firm contracts of purchase by import with foreign sellers, before the date of merger of pondicherry with india; in all the cases, the goods reached the destination, the port of pondicherry, after the date of merger. by that date (which was november 1, 1954) however the entire administration of pondicherry had become vested in the government of india, but pondicherry still remained a foreign territory. under section 4 of the , an order had been made on october 30, 1954, being notification s.r.o. 3315, in consequence of which the import and export (control) act, 1947, and the , along with several other indian statutes became laws in force in pondicherry. 6 of this order was in these words: \"unless otherwise specifically provided in the schedule, all laws in force in the french establishments immediately before the commencement of this order which corresponds to the enactments specified in the schedule shall cease to have effect, save as respects things done or omitted to be done before such commencement. \" when the goods arrived at the port of pondicherry they were confiscated, on the ground that they had been imported without licence. but an option was given to pay a penalty in lieu of confiscation. the petitioners paid the penalty and then came to this court for relief in making the order of confiscation and giving an option to the petitioners to pay penalty in lieu of confiscation the collector of customs proceeded on the (1) ; 426 basis of section 3(2) of the imports and exports trade (control) act read with section 67(8) of the . the ground on which relief was sought from this court was that to this act of importation, the indian statutes mentioned in notification s.r.o. 3315 did not apply because this was \"a thing done\" before the commencement of the order. if this contention succeeded, there was no escape from the conclusion that the order of confiscation had no legal basis, for the laws in force in the french establishments regarding the importation of goods into pondicherry did not require such licence. the controversy before the court therefore was whether the import was or was not \"a thing done\" within the meaning of the saving provisions of para. 6 of the order. on the one hand, it was urged that only the conclusion of the contract was \"a thing done\" before the commencement of the order and the importation the bringing of the goods across the customs barrier at pondicherry port which was the mere consequence of the contract could not, without undue strain on the language, be said to be a thing done before the commencement of the order. against this it was urged on behalf of the petitioners that the words \"things done\" included not only the things actually done and completed, but also their consequence. the majority decision of this court accepted the petitioners ' contention and also held that an import was the legal consequence of the contract that had been entered into by the petitioners with the foreign dealers and so where the contract was concluded before the date of commencement of the order, the import by bringing the goods into pondicherry port was also a \"thing done\" before the commencement of the order. it is helpful in this connection to reread what was said by our brother subba rao, j., speaking for the majority. after setting out the relevant facts he proceeded to say: \"on the said facts a short question arises whether paragraph 6 of the order protects the petitioners. while learned counsel for the petitioners contends that \"things done\" take in not only things done but also their legal consequences, learned 427 counsel for the state contends that, as the goods were not brought into india before the merger, it was not a thing done before the merger, and therefore, would be governed by the enactments specified in the schedule. it is not necessary to consider in this case whether the concept of import not only( takes in the factual bringing, of goods into india, but also the entire process of import commencing from the date of the application for permission to import and ending with the crossing of the customs barrier in india. the words \"things done\" in para. 6 must be reasonably interpreted and, if so interpreted they can mean not only things done but also the legal consequences flowing therefrom. if the interpretation suggested by the learned counsel for the respondents be accepted, the saving clause would become unnecessary. if what it saves, is only the executed contracts, i.e., the contracts where under the goods have been imported and received by the buyer before the merger, no further protection is necessary as ordinarily no question of enforcement of the contracts under the preexisting law would arise. \" after pointing out that the phraseology used had been copied from various previous statutes and referring to several english decisions as regards the interpretation of the words \"things done\" the conclusion of the majority was stated in these words: \"we therefore hold that the words \"things done\" in paragraph 6 of the, order are comprehensive enough to take in a transaction effected before the merger, though some of its legal effects and consequences projected into the post merger period. \" the question whether imports were the conse quences of the contract that had been entered into before the date of merger was next examined even though this position does not appear to have been seriously disputed, and the conclusion was stated thus: \". .", "completion": "in all the three petitions which were before the court in the universal imports agency case, the petitioners had entered into firm contracts of purchase by import with foreign sellers, before the date of merger of pondicherry with india;

and we cannot see how we can refuse to apply these principles. it is true that in that case the court had not to deal with the question of customs duty. the questions for decision were however pure questions of law: (i) whether the imports were the effect or the legal consequence of the \"things done\", i.e., the contracts entered into by the indian buyers with foreign dealers and (ii) whether \"things done\" mean not only things done but also the legal consequences flowing therefrom. whether these questions of law fell to be decided in a case, where the benefit of the saving clause is sought against an order of confiscation or as in the present case it is sought against an order for payment of customs duty is wholly irrelevant for the decisions of these questions of law. we wish to make it clear that we have no opinion to express as regards the decisions of these questions of law by the majority in the universal imports agency case. what we cannot ignore is that the law laid down by the majority on 429 those questions in that case is law and should be followed by this court as it has to be followed by other courts, the only difference being that this court can overrule those decisions. but so long as that is not done the law as laid down there is good law, which we in deciding the present case must obey. applying c. that law we are of opinion that we are bound to hold that the provisions in the for levy of customs duty on imports of the goods which were imported by the petitioners in the present case do not apply to these imports unless there is something in the order itself which deprives the act of importation from the benefit of the saving clause in respect of the customs duty. no such thing can be seen in the order. of the 6 paras of which it consists the first merely gives its name and says that it will come into force on the 1st day of november, 1954. the second para. defines the french establishments. the third para. which is the operative para. says that the enactments specified in col. 3 of the schedule as in force before the commencement of this order are hereby applied to, and shall be in force in french establishments subject to (a) amendments, (b) modifications, if any, specified in column 4 of the schedule and (c) the subsequent provisions of the order. 4 contains a rule of construction, viz., reference in any enactment, notification, rule, order or regulation. applied to the french establishments by this order, to india or to states or state generally shall be construed as including a reference to the french establishments;

27. the judgment of the court was delivered by dab gupta, j. the 51 appellants all of whom belong to village simla, tehsil, narwana, filed in the pepsu high court at patiala a petition under article 226 and article 227 of the constitution for relief against an order made by the divisional canal commissioner, narwana, for payment of certain water rates and tawan. it appears that on the night of september 1, 1951, there was a cut on the left bank of sirsa branch canal. certain persons were prosecuted on a charge for having damaged the canal but they were acquitted. thereafter, the divisional canal officer, narwana, on the recommendation of the sub divisional officer, canal, narwana made an order levying special charges against these appellants. on appeal the divisional canal officer, narwana, ordered in partial modification of the order made by the sub divisional officer, the levy of six times the crop rates on cultivated area and six times the charges on uncultivated area and single bulk rate on water store of village simla. this levy was made on the basis of his conclusion that the villagers of simla were responsible for the cut and joined hands for the common good. the high court dismissed the application by a short order stating that the points involved in this petition were fully covered by the decision of a division bench of the same high court in mukandi ram vs the executive engineer (lpa/fao no. 58 of 1954) and that the counsel for the petitioners had therefore nothing to say in support of the petition and did not press it. against this order of dismissal the present petition has been filed by special leave obtained from this court. before mentioning the points raised by mr. naunit lal in support of the appeal it would be convenient to refer to the provisions of law that require consideration. section 31 of the , which admittedly applies to the sirsa branch canal provides for the levy of water rates for 505 supply of canal water taken in the absence of contract at the rates and subject to the condition prescribed by the rules to be made by the state government in respect thereof. no rules have however been made as regards the rates to be charged for such unauthorised supply of canal water in respect of the sirsa branch canal which was in the state of patiala. rules had however been made by the 'punjab government in respect of the sirhind canal and branches thereof as also the western jumna canal and branches thereof as early as april 1873 and august 1878 respectively. these rules had been amended from time to time. at the time the sub divisional officer made his recommendation and the divisional canal officer made his order these rules had not been extended to the pepsu. it was when the appeal was pending before the commissioner that the pepsu sirhind canal and western jumna canal rules (enforcement and validation) act no. iv of 1954 was passed by the pepsu state legislature. section 3 of this act applied with retrospective effect from august 1, 1948, the sirhind canal rules and the western jumna canal rules to the pepsu state. section 4 provided that as from august 1, 1948, anything done or any action taken in accordance with the pepsu sirhind canal rules or the western jumna canal rules shall not be called in question in any proceedings before any court or other authority merely on the ground that the sirhind canal rules or the western jumna canal rules were not in force in the pepsu state on the date on which such thing was done or such action was taken. it may be mentioned that this act replaced the pepsu sirhind canal and western jumna canal rules (enforcement and validation) ordinance, 1954, which had been made shortly before this. in mukandi ram vs the executive engineer (1), on the basis of which without further discussion the petition in this case was dismissed the pepsu high court held on facts practically identical with the facts of this case that the levy of special rates by the canal commissioner was justified under rule 32 and in any case (1) lpa/fao no. 58 of 1954. 506 under rule 33 of the sirhind canal rules read with section 31 of the act. the main contention raised by mr. naunit lal before us in support of the present appeal is that section 3 and section 4 of the pepsu sirhind canal and western jumna canal rules (enforcement and validation) act no. iv of 1954 are unconstitutional being in contravention of article 20(1) of the constitution. other points that he wanted to urge were (i) that the provisions of rules 32 and 33 do not apply to the facts of the present case and (ii) that the notice served before the levy was made was not sufficient. as however it appeared clear to us that neither of these points was taken before the high court

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: the only point for our consideration therefore is whether section 3 and section 4 of the pepsu sirhind canal and western jumna canal rules (enforcement and validation) act, 1954, infringes the provisions of article 20(1) of the constitution. article 20(1) provides that no person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the act charged as an offence, nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence. it is argued on behalf of the appellants that the application by these sections of rules allowing the imposition of special rates which have been imposed under the provisions of rules 32 and 33 of the pepsu sirhind canal rules, which could not have been imposed at the time the water was used is bad, as thereby the appellants have been subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence. this argument is based on the assumption that the use of water by the appellants was an \"offence\" and 507 that the imposition of an enhanced water charge under rules 32 and 33 read with section 31 of the canal act for such use was \"a penalty\" for such an \"offence\". this assumption is clearly wrong. \"offence\" s as was pointed out by this court in maqbool hussain 's case (1) where article 20(2) of the constitution came up for consideration has not been defined in the constitution. so under article 367 which provides that the , shall apply for the interpretation of the constitution the word \"offence\" in the several clauses of article 20 must be understood to convey the meaning given to it in section 3(37) of the . that section defines an \"offence\" to mean an act or omission made punishable by any law for the time being in force. punishment is the mode by which the state enforces its laws forbidding the doing of something, or omission to do something. punishment may take different forms. it may be a mere reprimand; it may be a fine; it may be whipping; it may be imprisonment simple or rigorous; it may even extend to death. but whatever the form, punishment is always co related to a law of the state forbidding the doing or the omission to do something. unless such a law exists, there is no question of any act or omission being made \" punish able\". have we in the present case any law forbidding the unauthorised user of the water which section 31 of the canal act provides will be charged at rates that may be prescribed by rules? quite clearly, there is none. in providing for a charge to be made for use of water at rates that may be prescribed by rules the legislature is not prohibiting the use of water. the word \"unauthorised use\" in the section does not import any idea of prohibition. the intention of the law clearly is to obtain payment for water used; and the fact that the rates prescribed may be high cannot alter this position. we are therefore of opinion that the use of the water by the petitioners was not an \"offence\" and the order for levy of special rates for user thereof was not (1) ; 508 the imposition of a penalty for an offence. when the sub divisional canal officer or the canal commissioner was dealing with the matter they had to decide whether these petitioners had used water in an unauthorised manner and if so at what rates they should be charged for such use. in doing this, they were not trying anybody for any offence; and the fact that special rates were imposed did not deprive these rates of their essential character of a charge for water used and did not convert them into any penalty for the commission of an offence. there is therefore no scope here for the application of the provisions of article 20(1) of the constitution. the appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs. appeal dismissed.", "completion": "it is argued on behalf of the appellants that the application by these sections of rules allowing the imposition of special rates which have been imposed under the provisions of rules 32 and 33 of the pepsu sirhind canal rules, which could not have been imposed at the time the water was used is bad, as thereby the appellants have been subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence.\nthis argument is based on the assumption that the use of water by the appellants was an \"offence\" and 507 that the imposition of an enhanced water charge under rules 32 and 33 read with section 31 of the canal act for such use was \"a penalty\" for such an \"offence\".\nthat section defines an \"offence\" to mean an act or omission made punishable by any law for the time being in force.\nhave we in the present case any law forbidding the unauthorised user of the water which section 31 of the canal act provides will be charged at rates that may be prescribed by rules?"}

but the attempt failed. thereafter the present petition was filed by the respondent before the judicial commissioner, ajmer, and a large number of grounds were urged in support of it, and it was prayed that the registrar be prohibited from proceeding to deal with the application under r. 18 and the proceedings arising therefrom be quashed. the petition was decided by the judicial commissioner on april 18, 1956. he negatived all the contentions raised on behalf of the respondent except one; and it is with that contention only that we are concerned in the present appeal. that contention is that the registrar is in the position of a party and had expressed his opinion unequivocally against the respondent and other members of the committee in the notice 437 which he gave on february 26, 1955, and therefore his constituting himself as a tribunal to decide the dispute under r. 18 was against the principles of natural justice, inasmuch as a party constituted himself the judge. this contention found favour with the learned judicial commissioner and he held that although the registrar had no pecuniary or proprietary interest in the dispute yet in view of the circumstances of the case there was a strong likelihood of bias and therefore the registrar 's acting as the tribunal would be against the principles of natural justice. he further held that if the registrar had not suffered from the disability inherent in the situation, he would have been the most proper person to decide the dispute. the petition was therefore allowed and a writ of prohibition was issued to the registrar directing him not to proceed with the dispute before him.", "completion": "1 (hereinafter referred to as the respondent), along with certain other respondents were members of the managing committee of the bank.\nconsequently, the managing committee passed a resolution suspending the business of the bank subject to the approval of the registrar.\nthereupon the successor registrar, shri chitnis, gave notice to the respondent and other members of the managing committee on february 26, 1955, asking them to show cause why the committee should not be suspended under r.\nthe then registrar shri chitnis however appointed an administrator of the bank after removing the managing committee.\nin consequence of this application the then registrar appointed shri hem chand sogani, an advocate, as an arbitrator.\nthe application was in the nature of a misfeasance proceeding against the members of the managing committee and the prayer was for an award against thirteen persons (including the respondent) directing them to pay certain amounts including the entire loss amounting to about rs.\nthe appointment of the arbitrator was challenged by the president of the managing committee before the deputy commissioner through a revision petition but the challenge failed.\nconsequently, on december 13, 1955, the then registrar set aside the order appointing shri sogani as arbitrator and informed the parties that he would decide the dispute himself.\nthereafter the present petition was filed by the respondent before the judicial commissioner, ajmer, and a large number of grounds were urged in support of it, and it was prayed that the registrar be prohibited from proceeding to deal with the application under r.\nthat contention is that the registrar is in the position of a party and had expressed his opinion unequivocally against the respondent and other members of the committee in the notice 437 which he gave on february 26, 1955, and therefore his constituting himself as a tribunal to decide the dispute under r."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: this was followed by an application to the judicial commissioner for a certificate of fitness in order to file an appeal to this court, which was granted; and that is how the matter has come up before us. the official bias of the registrar is sought to be based on two circumstances: the first is the notice issued by the then registrar on february 26, 1955, asking the members of the managing committee (including the respondent) to show cause why they should not be suspended, and the second is that the registrar is the head of the co operative department and as such has certain legal powers over all co operative societies (including the bank) in his administrative capacity and therefore he would not be an impartial person to decide this dispute, particularly in view of the provisions of section 17 of the act. we are of opinion that there is no force in either of the contentions. turning to the notice of february 26, 1955, we are of opinion that there can be no inference of bias against the registrar as such because he gave that notice and afterwards ordered the removal of the managing committee. that notice was based on the report of the investigating auditors and was concerned with the collective responsibility of the 56 438 managing committee in the discharge of their duties. the proceedings under that notice have nothing in ,common with the proceedings in the present dispute which, as we have already said, are in the nature of misfeasance proceedings against certain members of the managing committee and in which their individual responsibility as members of the managing committee to make good the loss caused by the embezzlement falls to be considered. so far as the proceedings under the notice are concerned, the only question was whether on the facts found by the investigating auditors the managing committee should as a whole be allowed to act as such and all that the registrar in that connection did was to decide on the facts found by the investigating auditors that the managing committee should no longer be allowed to manage the affairs of the bank. that is a very different matter from the dispute in the present pro ceedings, namely, whether the particular members of the managing committee against whom the application under r. 18 has been made are responsible for making good the loss caused to the bank by the embezzlement, the fact of which is not in dispute. in the present proceedings therefore the registrar will have to decide the individual responsibility of the various members of the managing committee (including the respondent) in the matter of making good the loss caused to the bank. we are therefore of opinion that the fact that the registrar gave that notice for the purpose of the removal of the managing committee is no reason to hold that he would be biased in the investigation of individual responsibility of various members of the managing committee in this matter. we cannot therefore agree with the judicial commissioner that there can be any official bias in the registrar on this ground in connection with the present dispute and that such bias disentitles him to act as a judge or arbitrator under r. 18. the next contention is that the registrar being the administrative head of the department is in control of all the co operative societies in ajmer, including the bank. it is said that because of that administrative control which the registrar exercises through his 439 subordinates in the department, he is interested to see that the blame is put on the managing committee and that his department is freed from all blame. in, particular our attention has been drawn to section 17 which enjoins that the registrar shall audit or cause to be audited by some person authorised by him the accounts of every registered society once at least in every year. it is said that under this provision the registrar has been appointing chartered accountants to audit the accounts of the bank and that nothing wrong was discovered in the annual audits till the paid manager nandlal absconded and the defalcations came to light. we fail to appreciate how this general supervision of the registrar over all co operative societies can be said to amount to a bias in him so as to disentitle him to act as a judge or arbitrator under r. 18. it is not the respondent 's case that the registrar is in any way responsible for the day to day working of the bank. all that he is concerned with is to see that the accounts of the bank are audited yearly, and if necessary, to make inspections of the bank, if so authorised by the act and the rules. that, however, does not mean that the registrar is bound to shield the auditors or his subordinates who might have made the inspection of the bank and would so conduct the proceedings as to put the blame on the members of the managing committee. even if some blame attaches to the auditors appointed by the registrar or to his subordinates who might have inspected the bank, their fault would be that they failed to detect the embezzlement till the paid manager absconded. that, however, does not mean that the registrar was at any time a party to the fraud which resulted in the embezzlement. even the judicial commissioner recognises that the registrar has no personal interest in the matter and that he would but for the bias found by the judicial commissioner have been a most proper person to decide the dispute.", "completion": "the official bias of the

but this matter was decided against the judgment debtor and thereafter the execution has been proceeding uptil now on this application. on july 1, 1952, the u. p. zamindari abolition and land reforms act, 1950 (1 of 1951), hereinafter called the act, came into force. as a consequence of this enactment, the zamindari rights of the judgment debtor were abolished and it was no longer possible to sell these rights in the sixty seven villages. consequently, on september 29, 1952, the respondent made an application that as the zamindari rights could not be sold, only such rights of the judgment debtor as remained in him after the coming into force of the act might be sold, namely, the rights in trees and wells in abadi and buildings situate in various villages under sale. it was also prayed that the judgment debtor 's proprietary rights in grove land and sir and khudkashat land had been continued under section 18 of the act and these constituted substituted security in place of the proprietary rights mortgaged with the respondent and they should also be sold finally it was prayed that compensation money payable to the judgment debtor on the acquisition of the proprietary rights by the state might be treated as substituted security. the appellant objected to these applications on various grounds. the execution court held that the buildings, trees and wells situated in the abadi were liable to be sold in execution of the decree. it further held that the respondent was entitled to compensation amount granted by the state to the appellant in lieu of zamindari rights as substituted security. finally, it held that the bhumidari rights acquired by the 444 appellants under section 18 of the act could also be sold in execution of the decree. the appellant then took the matter in appeal to the high court, and the two points urged before the high court were (i) that the bhumidari rights created by section 18 (i) of the act could not be sold in execution of the decree, and (ii) that the application dated september 20, 1952, was a fresh application for execution and as it was filed over 12 years after the date of the amended decree it was barred by time. the high court repelled both these contentions, and held that execution could proceed against the bhumidari rights created in favour of the appellant under section 18 of the act and further that the application dated september 20, 1952, was within time as it was not a fresh application and the decree holder was only seeking to execute the decree in respect of the property for the sale of which he had already applied within time allowed by law. the high court therefore dismissed the appeal. the appellant then obtained a certificate to appeal to this court; and that is how the matter has come up before us. the main point urged on behalf of the appellant is that the decision of the high court that bhumidari rights created under section 18 of the act can also be sold in execution of the decree, is not correct. under the mortgage deed, the property mortgaged consisted of the property forming part of the talukdari of khajurgaon detailed at the foot of the mortgage, namely, the sixty seven villages. thus the mortgage consisted of the proprietary interests only of the mortgagor in the sixty seven villages, and as it was a simple mortgage, possession of no part of the property was given to the mortgagee. it is therefore contended by mr.", "completion": "appeal from the judgment and decree dated september 24, 1958, of the allahabad high court (lucknow bench) at lucknow in first execution of decree appeal no.\nin january 1925 a preliminary decree for the recovery of rupees four lacs and odd was passed, which was made final in july 1926 and directed the sale of the mortgaged property, namely, the proprietary rights of rana umanath bakshsingh in the sixty seven villages.\nconsequently, on september 29, 1952, the respondent made an application that as the zamindari rights could not be sold, only such rights of the judgment debtor as remained in him after the coming into force of the act might be sold, namely, the rights in trees and wells in abadi and buildings situate in various villages under sale.\nit was also prayed that the judgment debtor 's proprietary rights in grove land and sir and khudkashat land had been continued under section 18 of the act and these constituted substituted security in place of the proprietary rights mortgaged with the respondent and they should also be sold finally it was prayed that compensation money payable to the judgment debtor on the acquisition of the proprietary rights by the state might be treated as substituted security.\nfinally, it held that the bhumidari rights acquired by the 444 appellants under section 18 of the act could also be sold in execution of the decree.\nthe appellant then took the matter in appeal to the high court, and the two points urged before the high court were (i) that the bhumidari rights created by section 18 (i) of the act could not be sold in execution of the decree, and (ii) that the application dated september 20, 1952, was a fresh application for execution and as it was filed over 12 years after the date of the amended decree it was barred by time.\nthe high court repelled both these contentions, and held that execution could proceed against the bhumidari rights created in favour of the appellant under section 18 of the act and further that the application dated september 20, 1952, was within time as it was not a fresh application and the decree holder was only seeking to execute the decree in respect of the property for the sale of which he had already applied within time allowed by law.\nthe main point urged on behalf of the appellant is that the decision of the high court that bhumidari rights created under section 18 of the act can also be sold in execution of the decree, is not correct."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: aggarwala on behalf of the appellant that as the proprietary right in the sixty seven villages vested in the state under the act, the respondent who was only entitled to get the proprietary rights sold under the mortgage can now fall back only on compensation payable to the appellant under the act, and reliance in particular is placed on section 6 (h) of the act in this connection. on the other hand, the contention on 445 behalf of the respondent is that bhumidari rights arising under section 18 of the act are liable to be sold as they represented the proprietary rights which were mortgaged and in any case they can be sold as substituted security in place of the property mortgaged. we have therefore to look into the scheme of the act in order to decide between the rival contentions. it is not in dispute that the taluka of khajurgaon was an estate within the meaning of the act. it may be mentioned that the judgment debtor had certain sir and khudkashat lands and zamindar 's grove in the sixty seven villages comprised within the talukdari estate. section 4 of the act provides for vesting of an estate in the state on the making of a notification thereunder and the taluka of khajurgaon has vested in the state by virtue of such a notification made under section 4. section 6 prescribes the consequences of the vesting arising under section 4 and we may refer to section 6(a) (i) as that will show in what the interests of the judgment debtor ceased and became vested in the state: \"(a) all rights, title and interest of all the intermediaries (i) in every estate in such area including land (cultivable or barren), grove land, forests whether within or outside village boundaries, trees (other than trees in village abadi, holding or grove), fisheries, tanks, ponds, water channels, ferries, pathways, abadi sites hats, bazars or melas (other than hats, bazars, melas held upon land to which clauses (a) to (c) of sub section (1) of section 18 apply), and . . . . . . . . . shall cease and be vested in the state of uttar pradesh free from all encumbrances. \" clause (h) of section 6 is also material and is in these terms: \"(h) no claim or liability enforceable or incurred before the date of vesting by or against such intermediary for any money, which is charged on or is secured by a mortgage of such estate or part thereof shall, except as provided in section 73 of the , be enforceable against his interest in the estate. \" 57 446 all lands therefore whether cultivable or barren or grove lands vested in the state on the notification under section 4 having been made save as otherwise provided in this act. therefore, proprietary rights in sir and khudkashat land and grove land would vest in the state on the coming into force of the notification under section 4 unless there was some provision otherwise in the act. the contention of the respondent therefore that sir and khudkashat land and grove land continued to be the property of the appellant and would therefore remain liable to be sold in execution proceedings would fail in view of the notification under section 4, unless of course there is a provision otherwise in the act. the only provisions otherwise on which the respondent relies are sections 9 and 18 of the act. so far as section 9 is concerned, it is certainly a provision otherwise and it provides as follows: \"all wells or trees in abadi, and all buildings situate within the limits of an estate, belonging to or held by an intermediary or tenant or other person, whether residing in the village or not, shall continue to belong to or be held by such intermediary, tenant or person, as the case may be, and the site of the wells or the buildings with the area appurtenant thereto shall be deemed to be settled with him by the state government on such terms and conditions as may be prescribed. \" this provision clearly creates an exception to the property which vests in the state on the making of a notification under section 4. the exception is in favour of all wells and trees in abadi and all buildings and it is significant to note that these things will continue to belong to the intermediary, though the further provision shows that the site of the wells, and buildings with the area appurtenant thereto would vest in the government and would be deemed to be settled with the intermediary on such conditions and terms as may be prescribed. the effect therefore of section 9 is that wells, trees in abadi and buildings apart from the land under them continue to belong to the intermediary (and the appellant is undoubtedly an intermediary within the meaning of the act); but even here the 447 land on which the buildings and the wells stand vest in the state and it is deemed settled with the intermediary on terms and conditions to be prescribed. so far therefore as wells and trees in abadi and all buildings are concerned, these continue to belong to the appellant and if they are covered by the mortgage they would be liable to sale. as we have already pointed out, there was no dispute before the high court with respect to wells, and trees in abadi and buildings and it was conceded there that these were liable to be sold, the only dispute being with respect to bhumidari rights created under section 18.", "completion": "therefore, proprietary rights in sir and khudkashat land and grove land would vest in the state on the coming into force of the notification under section 4 unless there was some provision otherwise in the act.\nso far as section 9 is concerned, it is certainly a provision otherwise and it provides as follows: \"all wells or trees in abadi, and all buildings situate within the limits of an estate, belonging to or held by an intermediary or tenant or other person, whether residing in the village or not, shall continue to belong to or be held by such intermediary, tenant or person, as the case may be, and the site of the wells or the buildings with the area appurtenant thereto shall be deemed to be settled with him by the state government on such terms and conditions as may be prescribed.\nthe effect therefore of section 9 is that wells, trees in abadi and buildings apart from the land under them continue to belong to the intermediary (and the appellant is undoubtedly an intermediary within the meaning of the act);

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: let us now turn to section 18 and see whether it is also a provision otherwise like section 9. the relevant part of section 18 for our purposes is in these terms: \"(1) subject to the provisions of sections 10, 15, 16 and 17, all lands (a) in possession of or held or deemed to be held by an intermediary as sir, khudkashat or an intermediary 's grove, on the date immediately preceding the date of vesting shall be deemed to be settled by the state government with such intermediary, lessee, or tenant, grantee or grove holder, as the case may be, who shall subject to the provisions of this act be entitled to take or retain possession as a bhumidar thereof. \" it is well to contrast the language of this section with the language of section 9. section 9 lays down that trees and wells in abadi and buildings shall continue to belong to the intermediary and that shows that it was a provision otherwise excepting these three items from vesting in the state by virtue of the notification under section 4 and its consequence under section 6; but there is no provision in section 18 of the act to the effect that sir and khudkashat land and intermediary 's grove shall continue to belong to the intermediary. therefore, sir and khudkashat land and grove land would vest in the state by virtue of section 6 (a) (i) for there is no provision otherwise in section 18 in that behalf. in this connection we may refer for comparison to section 23 of the 448 rajasthan land reforms and resumption of jagirs act, no. vi of 1952 (hereinafter called the rajasthan act) which provides that \"notwithstanding anything contained in the last preceding section (i.e. section 22, which refers to consequences of resumption), all khudkashat lands of a jagirdar etc. shall continue to belong to or be held by such jagirdar or other person\". if the intention of the act was not to vest sir and khudkashat land and grove land in the state we would have found an exception similar to that found in the rajasthan act. section 9 itself shows in what manner the legislature was making an exception when it did not intend that a particular property should vest in the state. if the intention were that sir and khudkashat land and grove land should not vest in the state, section 18 would have been worded in the same way as section 9. further the way in which section 18 is worded, (namely that khudkashat and sir land and an intermediary 's grove shall be deemed to be settled with the intermediary and he would have bhumidari rights therein) shows that these three kinds of property vested in the state under section 6(a)(1) and were then resettled with the intermediary on a new tenure and not in the same right, which he had in them before the vesting. the legislature was therefore creating a new right under section 18 and the old proprietary right in sir and khudkashat land and any intermediary 's grove land had already vested under section 6 in the state. therefore, it cannot be said that section 18 is an exception to the consequences provided in section 6 and therefore sir and khudkashat land and grove land continue to be the property of the judgment debtor in this case in the same manner as they were his property at the time of the mortgage and would therefore be available in execution of the decree as the proprietary rights mortgaged. we are of opinion that the proprietary rights in sir and khudkashat land and in grove land have vested in the state and what is conferred on the intermediary by section 18 is a new right altogether which he never had and which could not therefore have been mortgaged in 1914. our attention in this connection was drawn to the 449 compensation sections in the act, and it was urged that what was given to the intermediary under section 18 was really his old right because no compensation was to be paid to him with respect to what was left to him under section 18. the first section to be considered in this connection is section 39 which deals with gross assets of a mahal. in these gross assets the amount computed at the rates applicable to the ex proprietary tenants of similar land for land in the personal cultivation of or held as intermediary 's grove, khudkashat or sir by all the intermediaries in the estate was to be included subject to certain exceptions which are immaterial for our purposes. the very fact that in the gross assets the rents of these lands in which the bhumidari rights were created under section 18 were taken into consideration shows that these lands also vested in the state; if that were not so there was no necessity for including these assets in the gross assets for the purposes of compensation. here again we may refer to a similar provision in the rajasthan act for purposes of comparison. the second schedule to that act provides how gross income is to be calculated and in calculating the gross income the income from khudkashat land has not been taken into account because it was excepted from the consequence of resumption under section 23 of that act. it is true that under section 44 of the act when calculating net assets, the income from sir and khudkashat land and grove land has been excluded on the ground that bhumidari rights have been conferred therein under section 18 of the act.", "completion": "the relevant part of section 18 for our purposes is in these terms: \"(1) subject to the provisions of sections 10, 15, 16 and 17, all lands (a) in possession of or held or deemed to be held by an intermediary as sir, khudkashat or an intermediary 's grove, on the date immediately preceding the date of vesting shall be deemed to be settled by the state government with such intermediary, lessee, or tenant, grantee or grove holder, as the case may be, who shall subject to the provisions of this act be entitled to take or retain possession as a bhumidar thereof.\nsection 9 lays down that trees and wells in abadi and buildings shall continue to belong to the intermediary and that shows that it was a provision otherwise excepting these three items from vesting in the state by virtue of the notification under section 4 and its consequence under section 6; but there is no provision in section 18 of the act to the effect that sir and khudkashat land and intermediary 's grove shall continue to belong to the intermediary.\nfurther the way in which section 18 is worded, (namely that khudkashat and sir land and an intermediary 's grove shall be deemed to be settled with the intermediary and he would have bhumidari rights therein) shows that these three kinds of property vested in the state under section 6(a)(1) and were then resettled with the intermediary on a new tenure and not in the same right, which he had in them before the vesting.\nthe legislature was therefore creating a new right under section 18 and the old proprietary right in sir and khudkashat land and any intermediary 's grove land had already vested under section 6 in the state."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: that is however for the purposes of calculating what should, be paid to the intermediary as compensation and in that connection it was necessary to take into account the fact that the legislature was creating a new right in the intermediary with respect to certain lands and therefore it was not necessary to give money as compensation. that would not however make any difference in our view as to the legal effect of the notification under section 4 and under the notification sir and khudkashat land and grove land would vest in the state and would not be an exception to the consequences of vesting in section 6 and therefore the proprietary right in sir 450 and khudkashat land and grove land which were mortgaged would be extinguished and the bhumidari right which is created by section 18 would be a new right altogether and would not therefore be considered to be included under the mortgage in this case. this brings us to a consideration of section 6(h) of the act. that lays down that \"no claim or liability enforceable or incurred before the date of vesting by or against such intermediary for any money, which is charged on or is secured by a mortgage of such estate or part thereof shall, except as provided in section 73 of the , be enforceable against his interest in the estate\". this provision has in our opinion a, two fold effect. in the first place, it makes it impossible for the mortgagee to follow the proprietary right after it vests in the state. secondly, it provides that the only way in which the mortgagee can recover his none advanced on the security of the property which vested in the state by virtue of the notification under section 4 and the consequences thereof under section 6 is to follow the procedure under section 73 of the . section 73(2) provides that \"where the mortgaged property or any part thereof or any interest therein is acquired under the land acquisition act, 1894 (1 of 1894), or any other enactment for the time being in force providing for the compulsory acquisition of immovable property, the mortgagee shall be entitled to claim payment of the mortgage money, in whole or in part, out of the amount due to the mortgagor as compensation\". there is no doubt that the property mortgaged has been compulsorily acquired in this case by the state under the act. therefore, section 6 (h) read with section 73 directs that the mortgagee shall proceed in the manner provided in section 73, namely, follow the compensation money, and there is no other way possible for him in view of section 6(h) with respect to the property which has been acquired under the act. we have held that sir and khudkashat land and grove land have been acquired under the act and have vested in the state; therefore the mortgagee is relegated to enforce his rights against the mortgagor in the manner provided in section 73 of the 451 and in no other way. what we say here does not affect that property which is not acquired by the state, for example, property excepted under section 9 of the act; but where the property has vested in the state by virtue of a notification under section 4 and its consequences under section 6, the only course open to the mortgagee is to follow the compensation money under section 6(h). the bhumidari rights created under section 18 are not compensation; they are special rights conferred on the intermediary by virtue of his cultivatory possession of the lands comprised therein. the respondent therefore cannot enforce his rights under the mortgage by sale of the bhumidari rights created in favour of the appellant under section 18 so far as his sir and khudkashat land and grove land are concerned; it can only follow the compensation money as provided in section 6(h). the argument that bhumidari rights can 'be followed as substituted security must therefore equally fail. our attention in this connection was drawn to section 8(2) of the u. p. zamindars debt reduction act, no. xv of 1953. that act provides for scaling down of debts of zamindars whose estates have been acquired under the act. it also provides that the debts due shall be realisable from the compensation and rehabilitation grant, and in particular section 8(2) provides that \"notwithstanding anything in any law the reduced amount found in the case of a mortgagor or judgment debtor as the case may be, under section 3 or 4 as respects mortgaged estates shall not be legally recoverable otherwise than out of the compensation and rehabilitation grant payable to such mortgagor or judgment debtor in respect of such estates\". we have not been able to understand how the provisions of the u. p. zamindars debt reduction act can affect the con struction of section 6(h) of the act read with other provisions of the act. it is not necessary for us therefore to construe section 8(2) of the u. p. zamindars debt reduction act, for we are clear on the provisions of section 6 (h) and the other provisions of the act that bhumidari rights created in favour of the appellant cannot be sold in execution of the decree held against him by the respondent under the mortgage of 1914. 452 this brings us to the question of limitation. mr. aggarwala conceded that if the appellant succeeds on the first point it would not be necessary for us to consider the question of limitation.", "completion": "therefore, section 6 (h) read with section 73 directs that the mortgagee shall proceed in the manner provided in section 73, namely, follow the compensation money, and there is no other way possible for him in view of section 6(h) with respect to the property which has been acquired under the act.\nwe have held that sir and khudkashat land and grove land have been acquired under the act and have vested in the state;

1948 on certificates granted by the high court under article 133(1)(c) of the constitution. the facts leading to this litigation lie in a narrow compass. one prithi dubey died on july 14, 1932, leaving him surviving, his widow laung kuer, who succeeded as heir to his estate. for the purpose of discharging debts due by the deceased laung kuer executed on june 21, 1935, a zerpeshgi deed in favour of two persons, rajdewan dubey and kailash dabey, who were also the next reversioners, for a sum of rs. 1,100. it is not in dispute that this deed is binding on the reversioners. on june 17, 1943, laung kuer sold to the appellant a portion of the properties which were the subject matter of the zerpeshgi deed dated june 21, 1935, for a consideration of rs. 1,600 out of this amount, a sum of rs. 1,100 was reserved with the purchaser for redemption of the zerpeshgi, and the balance of rs. 500 was paid in cash. it is recited in the deed of sale that a sum of rs. 100 was required to effect repairs to the family dwelling house, a sum of rs. 200 for purchasing two bulls for agricultural purposes, and a sum of rs. 200 for repairing a well, which had been constructed by the deceased for user by the public and which was then in a ruined condition. it is to meet these expenses that laung kuer raised rs. 500. after obtaining the sale deed, the appellant sought 561 to redeem the zerpeshgi, but the zerpeshgidars refused to receive the amount and surrender possession of the properties. the appellant deposited the mortgage amount in court under section 83 of the transfer of property act and then instituted title suit no. 69 of 1944 for redemption. meantime the reversioners, the respondents herein, had filed title suit no. 126 of 1943 for a declaration that the sale deed in favour the appellant was not binding on the reversioners. and both the suits were tried together. the parties were at issue on several questions of fact of which the only one material at this stage is whether the sale in favour of the appellant was supported by necessity and binding on the reversioners. the district munsif of palamau who tried the suits held on a review of the evidence that necessity was established in respect of all the four items of consideration and that the sale was binding on the reversioners. he accordingly dismissed title suit no. 126 of 1943 filed by the respondents and granted a decree for redemption in title suit no. 69 of 1944 filed by the appellant. the respondents herein, the reversioners, preferred appeals against both the decrees passed by the district munsif of palamau and they were heard by the subordinate judge of palamau, who, agreeing with the findings given by the district munsif, affirmed the decrees and dismissed the appeals. against these decrees, the respondents preferred second appeals nos. 2155 and 2156 of 1948 in the high court of patna. while these appeals were pending, laung kuer died on march 14, 1952, and on the application of the respondents, the plaint in title suit no. 126 of 1943 was amended by adding reliefs for possession and mesne profits. the appeals were then heard by a bench consisting of rai and misra, jj., who in separate but concurring judgments, held that the sale deed in favour of the appellant was not binding on the reversioners. misra, j., who delivered the leading judgment did not disagree with the finding of the courts below that all the four items of consideration were supported by necessity. indeed, being a finding of fact, it would be binding on the court in second 562 appeal. he, however, held, following the decision in dasrath singh vs damri singh (1) that a widow cannot by selling properties subject to usufructuary mortgage jeopardise the right of the reversioners to redeem, and that, therefore, the sale would not be binding on them. a different view was taken in lala ram asre singh vs ambica lal (1), where it was held that a widow was not debarred from selling properties subject to mortgage where there was necessity for it merely by reason of the fact that they were subject to usufructuary mortgage which contained no personal covenant to pay. but the learned judge declined to follow this decision and stated the reason thus: \"following, therefore, the settled practice of this court as laid down in a number of decisions, the only course left open to us in the circumstances would be either to follow the previous division bench ruling in preference to the later or to refer the case to a larger bench for settling the position. in my

a.i.r. 1927 pat.(2) 1i pat.l.t. 6; a.i.r. 1929 pat.563 order dated november 27, 1956, that there being a conflict between the decisions in dasrath singh 's case (1) and lala ram asre singh 's case (2), the point was one of sufficient importance for grant of leave to appeal to this court. they also stated that the question as to the practice to be followed when there was a conflict of decisions, was likewise one of public importance, which ought to be settled by this court. they accordingly granted certificates under article 133 (1)(c) and that is how these appeals come before us. before considering the two questions referred to in the order of the high court granting certificates, we shall deal with a contention raised on behalf of the respondents, which if well founded would necessitate a remand of these appeals. it was argued that the sale deed in favour of the appellant was not bona fide, that it had been so held by the district munsif, but that the subordinate judge had failed to record a finding on this question, and that therefore there should be a remand for a decision on that point. as already stated, rai, j., appears to have been impressed by this contention. but when the contention is further examined it will be found to be wholly without substance. what the district munsif said was that \"after the death of prithi dubey the relatives of lawan kuer had fallen on her property like vultures\", and that it was quite possible \"that the transaction in question was also brought at their instance and they were also benefited by it.\" this only means that the relatives of laung kuer were guilty of spoliation of the estate. but that would not affect the rights of the appellant unless he was a party to it, which, however, is not the case, and that is what the district munsif himself observes with reference to this aspect: \"but in the present suit i have got to consider the interest of jaisri sahu who has in good faith already paid rs. 500 to the mostt.and has deposited the balance of rs. 1,100 in court for the redemption of the zarpeshgi.\" this finding that the appellant himself acted bona fide was not challenged before the subordinate judge (1) 8 pat.l.t. 314.a.i.r. 1927 pat. 219.(2) 11 pat.l.t. 6; a.i.r. 1929 pat.564 on appeal and the point is accordingly not open to the respondents. dealing next with the points mentioned in the order of the high court dated november 27, 1956, the first question that arises for decision is whether a sale by a widow of properties which are the subject matter of a usufructuary mortgage is beyond her powers when the mortgagee cannot sue to recover the amount due on the mortgage. this has been answered in the affirmative by the learned judges of the high court on the strength of the decision in dasrath singh vs damri singh (1). there the last male holder, one sitaram singh, had created a usufructuary mortgage, and after his death the widow sold the property for the discharge of this debt and of certain other debts, and for meeting the marriage expenses of her daughter and grand daughter. it was held by das and adami, jj., that all these items of consideration were supported by necessity, but nevertheless the sale was not binding on the reversioners. das, j., who delivered the judgment observed as follows \"it is contended that under the terms of the usufructuary mortgage it would be open now to the plaintiffs to redeem that mortgage and it is pointed out that their right to redeem should not have been jeopardised by the widow by the transfer of the property to the mortgagee. in my opinion this argument is right and should prevail.\" if the learned judge intended to lay down as an inflexible proposition of law that, whenever there is a usufructuary mortgage, the widow cannot sell the property, as that would deprive the reversioners of the right to redeem the same, we must dissent from it. such a proposition could be supported only if the widow is in the position of a trustee, holding the estate for the benefit of the reversioners, with a duty cast on her to preserve the properties and pass them on intact to them. that, however, is not the law. when a widow succeeds as heir to her husband, the ownership in the properties, both legal and beneficial, vests in her.", "completion": "following, therefore, the authority of this court in dasrath singh 's case which completely covers the present case, it must be held that the courts below were in error in relying upon the decision in lala ram asre singh 's case.\" in the result the learned judge held that the sale deed in favour of the appellant dated june 17, 1943, was not binding on the reversioners.\nrai, j., expressed the view that as the bona fides of the sale in favour of the appellant was questioned by the reversioners and as there had been no finding on that point by the subordinate judge, the matter might have to be remanded for a finding on that question, but that, as the sale deed was not supported by necessity, he agreed with the conclusion of misra, j.\nj., and raj kishore prasad, j., observed in their (1) 8 pat.l.t. 314;

it was a subsisting debt, only the creditor was in possession of a part of the estate and was unable to recover it by instituting a suit in the civil courts. but the result was that a considerable portion of the income was withdrawn from basmati kuer who had succeeded her husband. it is well established that where a case of necessity exists, an heiress is not bound to borrow money, with the hope of paying it off before her death. nor is she bound to mortgage the estate, and thereby reduce her income for life. she is at liberty, if she thinks fit, absolutely to sell off a part of the estate.\" in our judgment these observations correctly state the position in law. it will be noticed that das, j., deli (1) 8 pat.l. t. 314;

(2) the newspaper in which the advertisement was published was not selected by the council; (3) time given in the notification was fixed not by the council, but by the commissioner; and (4) the period prescribed in the notification, that is, \" within 30 days \", was not fixed by the council and was not in accordance with the act. the respondent municipal council denied these allegations and several issues were raised and the suits were decreed. the appeal which had been taken in the suit by the trust was also decided in favour of that plaintiff. the result was that all the suits and the appeal were decided against the respondent municipal council. it took four appeals to the high court. the decrees were reversed and the suits of the various plaintiffs were dismissed. against those judgments and decrees, these four appeals have been brought by the plaintiffs, in the various suits, who are now the appellants. 612 in civil appeals nos. 499 to 501, counsel for the appellants has raised two points (1) that the publication was not by the council and (2) that the time given in the notification, i.e., \" within 30 days \" was not in accordance with the law and as these were conditions precedent to the legality of the resolution under section 79 the resolution was ultra vires and therefore the imposition of the tax was illegal. it is, therefore, necessary to examine the various provisions of the act upon which the whole argument has proceeded. chapter vi of the act deals with taxation and finance. in section 77 are enumerated the various taxes which can be levied by municipal councils. section 78 gives the procedure for the levying of the tax and when quoted it is as follows: \"section 78. resolution of council determining to levy tax or tolls.", "completion": "the appellants were the plaintiffs in the respective suits out of which these appeals have arisen and the respondent was the defendant in all the suits.\non september 9, 1943, the nagercoil municipal council the respondent, passed a resolution under section 78 of the travancore district municipalities act (act xxiii of the malayalam year 1116), hereinafter called the act.\non january 12,,1944, a resolution under section 79 of the act wag passed, by which the profession tax became payable from the beginning of the second half of the malayalam year 1119.\nthree private limited companies carrying on business brought three suits challenging the legality of the imposition of the tax out of which the other three appeals, i.e., civil appeals nos.\nin these suits, it was alleged that the publication of the resolution was not in accordance with the provisions of section 78 of the act in so far as (1) it was not published by the respondent municipal council, but by the commissioner;

counsel for the appellants in the first three appeals argued, and that argument was adopted by counsel for the appellant in the fourth appeal, that the words used in the first proviso to section 78 required that a clear period of one month had to be given for inviting objections and as \"within thirty days\" was not a clear period of one month, the provisions of the section had not been complied with. in support of his contention that the provision as to time was a mandatory requirement, he particularly stressed three words and phrases used in that proviso: (1) \"before passing a resolution \" ; (2) \" shall publish \" ; and (3) \" fix a reasonable period not being less than one month for submission of objections. \" the argument was that where these words are used, the effect was that the requirements were mandatory and not merely directory. it was submitted that the words \"before\" and \",shall \" provided that what was mentioned in the proviso were conditions precedent for giving power to the municipal council to pass a resolution under a. 79 and when those two words were read along with \" not being less than one month \", it was a clear indication of the mandatory nature of the requirements of the section. quite a number of cases were relied upon by counsel and besides this it was also emphasized that sections 78 and 79 concerned taxing matters and as the liability of the taxpayers arises after the tax is legally imposed, strict compliance with the provisions was necessary. it is not necessary to discuss all the cases on which reliance was placed. the words \" not being 'less than one month \" do imply that clear one month 's notice was necessary to. be given, that is, both the first day and the last day of the month had to be excluded. to put it in the language used by maxwell on interpretation of statutes, 10th edition, p. 351 : \". when. .", "completion": "the executive authority of the municipal council shall (a) carry into effect the resolutions of the council; (b) furnish to the council such periodical reports regarding the progress made in carrying out the resolutions of that body in the collection of taxes as the council may direct; and (c) perform all the duties and exercise all the powers specifically imposed or conferred on the executive authority by this act, and subject, whenever it is hereinafter expressly so provided, to the sanction of the council, and subject to all other restrictions, limitations and conditions hereinafter imposed, exercise the executive power for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this act and be directly responsible for the due fulfilment of the purposes of this act.\n\" section 16, which contains the power of the executive authority, does not support the contention of the appellants, because it provides that the executive authority has to give effect to the resolutions of the council and has to perform all duties specifically imposed on the executive authority by the act and can also exercise executive power for the carrying out of the provisions of the act and can act without sanction, unless the act otherwise requires.\ntherefore, when the commissioner of the respondent council got published a notification of the resolution under section 78 of the act to impose a tax, he was acting within his powers and the fixing of the time in which objection had to be made was provided under the act and was not exercise of authority by the executive which it did not possess.\nin support of his contention that the provision as to time was a mandatory requirement, he particularly stressed three words and phrases used in that proviso: (1) \"before passing a resolution \" ; (2) \" shall publish \" ; and (3) \" fix a reasonable period not being less than one month for submission of objections."}

(1) where the notice under section 22(2) of the income tax act (which requires the furnishing of a return within such period not being less than thirty days) of 30 days only was held to be bad, because it was not a notice of thirty clear days, were so decided because that notice is the basis of the jurisdiction to tax, and a legal notice is an obligation imposed in order to tax an individual and it is a mandatory provision. similarly, cases under rent act will also not apply. in thompson vs stimpson (2) the law required that not less than four (1) [1945]13 i.t.r. 154. (2) , 79 weeks ' notice shall be given for vacation of premises on a weekly tenancy and only one week 's time was given. it was held there that it was a bad notice. it was further held that four weeks ' notice was a condition precedent and the words had been used which had been interpreted in the past as providing for four clear weeks and also it was construed as four clear weeks, so that there might be certainty in the matter. in other cases, that were relied upon and which related to taxing statutes, the municipal council, cuddapah vs the madras and southern mahratta railway ltd.

suitability to promotion is considered on other relevant grounds .as well. the respondent was initially recruited to the grade of rs. 200 300 and was confirmed in that, grade on november 21, 1956. between may 23, 1958, and august 22, 1958 as well as between december 8, 1958 and december 31, 1958, he was promoted to officiate in the grade of rs. 260 350. he got a chance of another similar promotion to officiate on april 8, 1959. these promotions were in the nature of ad hoc promo tions and were consequently of temporary duration. later, on june 16, 1959, he was interviewed by the selection committee and his promotion to the said higher grade was regularised and an order was passed in that behalf on june 30, 1959. by this order lie was allowed to continue to officiate in the said grade. since then he has been officiating in that grade. on april 27, 1959, and on june 12, 1959, the two impugned circulars were issued by the railway board and addressed to the general managers. as a result of the said circulars the selection committee decided to consider the case of hiriyanna for promotion to the grade of rs. 260 350, hiriyanna being a member of the scheduled castes. the record shows that at the time when the respondent was interviewed and selected he was placed as number one by the selection committee and one partliasarathy was placed as number two. on the said occasion hiriyanna was not selected and put in the panel. the selection committee desired to examine the case of hiriyania in order to decide whether he was suitable for promotion to higher grade in the light of the two directives issued by the railway board and so a meeting of the selection committee was called on november 18, 1959. the respondent thought that the proceedings of the said proposed meeting may result prejudicially to his interest and so on november 16, 1959, he filed the 591 present writ petition no. 1051 of 1959. in this petition he applied for a writ in the nature of mandamus and also prayed for an interim injunction restraining the holding of the meeting of the selection committee proposed to be held on november 18, 1959. an interim injunction as prayed for by the respondent was issued by the high court and in consequence the proposed meeting has not been held. according to the respondent the two directives issued by the appellants under the two impugned circulars were ultra vires, illegal, inoperative and unconstitutional in that they were not justified by article 16(4). he alleged that a reading of articles 16, 335, 338 and 339 would show that the constitution draws a clear distinction between scheduled castes or tribes on the one hand and backward classes on the other and so it was urged by him that the impugned circulars were illegal. the petition further urged that the safeguard provided by article 16(4) applied only to reservation of posts at the stage of appointment and not for reservation of posts for promotion after appointment and so the circulars were outside the provisions of article 16(4) and as such contravened article 16(1).", "completion": "it seems to me that reservation of posts in various grades in the same service is bound to result, for obvious reasons, in deterioration in the efficiency of administration;

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: it seems to me that reservation of posts in various grades in the same service is bound to result, for obvious reasons, in deterioration in the efficiency of administration; and reading article 335 along with article 16(4) which to my mind is permissible on the principle of harmonious construction (see pandit m. section m. sharma vs shri sri krishna sinha (1)), it could not be the intention of the constitution makers that reservation in article 16(4), for at any rate a part of those comprised therein, should result in the impairment of the efficiency of administration. it also seems to me equally obvious that what applies to a part of those comprised in the words \"any backward class of citizens\" also applies to the whole. therefore, in the absence of clear words in article 16(4) which would compel one to hold that reservation was meant to apply not only to the service taken as a whole but also to various grades in which the service might be divided, i feel that an interpretation should not be given which would result in the impairment of efficiency of administration, which is jealously safeguarded even when considering the claims of the scheduled castes and the scheduled tribes. i am therefore of opinion that giving the words used in article 16(4) as liberal an interpretation as is possible without destroying or making illusory the fundamental right guaranteed in article 16(1) to which article 16(4) is in the nature of an exception or a proviso, article 16(4) can only mean that the state has the power thereunder to reserve numerically a certain percentage of appointments or posts in the manner i have indicated above and it has no power to split the service into various grades which might exist in it and make reservation in each grade because of the use of the word \"posts\" therein. i would therefore dismiss the appeal but for different reasons. (1) , 859 60 78 614 ayyangar, j. i regret that i cannot share the view of my learned brethren expressed by gajendragadkar, j. that the appeal should be allowed and i agree with wanchoo, j. that the appeal should be dismissed and the order of the high court maintained. the facts of the case have been set out in great detail in the judgments already delivered and it is unnecessary to repeat them. mr. chatterji when he opened the appeal appeared to claim that the scope and content of article 16(1) and of sub article (4) thereof were identical and that if article 16(1) guaranteed by the use of the wide expression \"matters relating to employment\", \"equality of opportunity\" in relation to promotions also, article 16(4) should be construed to have the same width. but this argument however he abandoned at a later stage. the point therefore does not call for any consideration and the judgments now delivered proceed on the basis that the scope of the limitation on the equality of opportunity which is provided in article 16(4) is not co extensive with the freedom guaranteed by article 16(1). the only question therefore is in what respect is article 16(4) narrower than article 16(1). in considering this the rule of construction should be borne in mind that a restriction on a guaranteed freedom should be narrowly construed so as to afford sufficient scope for the freedom guaranteed. the judgment of the learned judge now under appeal proceeds on the basis that the expression \"posts\" in article 16(4) was a reference to what are termed in service parlance 'ex cadre posts ' and not posts in the service. mr. chatterji 's submission was that the learned judge had no basis for importing the nomenclature and the classifications to be found in part xiv into part iii dealing with fundamental rights. in particular, mr. chatterji quarrelled with the statement by the learned judge that the expression appointments and posts ' occurring in article 16(4) were \"virtually terms of art which had to be interpreted and understood in the light of the legislative history of the constitutional enactments that 615 preceded the constitution, and in consonance with the scheme that underlies the provisions of the constitution, which have reference to the civil services ' and civil servants in this country.\" mr. chatterji ' further pointed out that the learned judge went wrong in observing that \"the expressions appointments and posts in article 16(4) have really to be read as appointments to services and appointments to posts\" on the ground that the words used in article 16 '4) were merely \"appointments and posts\" and not \"appointments to services\" etc. , the latter occurring only in part xiv. it was,, however, common ground that if the learned judge was right in considering that \"appointments\" in article 16(4) meant \"appointments to services,\" the notification now impugned should be held to be unconstitutional. mr. chatterji did not dispute that when the expressions 'appointments to services and appointments to posts ' occurred in ch. xiv vide for instance in articles 309, 311, etc. , being phrases borrowed from statutory provisions of the government of india act, 1935, the expression 'appointment to a post ' designated an 'ex cadre post '. the submission, however, of learned counsel was that there was no justification for importing the phraseology employed in part xiv in article 16(4), notwithstanding that article 16 dealt with equality of opportunity for employment in the services of the state and sub article (4) was concerned with the reservation of appointments in services under the state.", "completion": "article 335 runs: \"the claims of the members of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes shall be taken into consideration, consistently with the maintenance of efficiency of administration, in the making of appointments to services and posts in connection with the affairs of the union or of a state.\nit is only necessary to add that article 320(4) which runs: \"nothing in clause (3) shall require a public service commission to be consulted as respects the manner in which any provision referred to in clause (4) of article 16 may be made or as respects the manner in which effect may be given to the provisions of article 335.\" to which learned counsel for the respondent drew our attention indicates, if other indication were necessary., that articles 16(4) and 335 have to be read together and not as if the 'posts ' referred to in article 335 indicated a different idea or connoted a different concept from the same word used in article 16(4).\nhas pointed out, the crucial words in article 16(4), and which form as it were 617 the key to its interpretation, from which the power of the state to make the reservation stems, are that a class of citizens \"is not adequately represented in the services of the state.\" the action permitted to be taken to redress this inadequacy is by reservation of appointments and posts.\ni have drawn attention to this because it pointedly demonstrates that the correct view is that when \"inadequacy of representation\" is referred to in article 16(4) as justifying a reservation, the only rational and reasonable construction of the words are that it refers to a quantitative deficiency in the representation of the backward classes in the service taken as a whole and not to an inadequate representation at each grade of service or in respect of each post in the service.\nunder article 16(4) the state is enabled to make provision for the reservation of appointments if in their opinion certain backward classes of citizens are not adequately represented in the service."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: his submission was that article 16(4) had no legislative precedent in the previous constitutional enactments to justify the importation of service rules and service jargon as an aid to its construction. my learned brothers have acceded to this submission of mr. chatterji. with great respect to them i consider that the view of the learned judge of the high court is correct. in the first place, the article being one concerning the right to be employed in the services of the state, one has necessarily to turn on the relevant provisions in relation to the services to discover the precise import of the expressions used in relation to the services. besides, we are not left in 616 doubt as to the inter connection between article 16 and part xiv dealing with services, because article 335 forms, as it were, the link between part xiv and the provisions for reservation in favour of the backward communities in article 16(4) betting out as it does the principles that should guide the state in the matter of reservation in the services which could obviously be only a reference to that provided for by article 16(4). article 335 runs: \"the claims of the members of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes shall be taken into consideration, consistently with the maintenance of efficiency of administration, in the making of appointments to services and posts in connection with the affairs of the union or of a state. \" in this article, at any rate, it cannot be contended, and i did not understand mr. chatterji to contend, that 'posts ' had any reference to 'posts in the services. ' if it were so then in my judgment it would follow that the phraseology employed in this article which deals with the same subject as that dealt with by article 16(4) throws light on and explains the meaning of the expression 'posts ' in article 16(4). it is only necessary to add that article 320(4) which runs: \"nothing in clause (3) shall require a public service commission to be consulted as respects the manner in which any provision referred to in clause (4) of article 16 may be made or as respects the manner in which effect may be given to the provisions of article 335.\" to which learned counsel for the respondent drew our attention indicates, if other indication were necessary., that articles 16(4) and 335 have to be read together and not as if the 'posts ' referred to in article 335 indicated a different idea or connoted a different concept from the same word used in article 16(4). even if the above view were wrong and the expression 'posts ' were intended to designate not 'ex cadre posts ' but 'posts in the service, ' i am unable to hold that the appellant derives any advantage. as my learned brother wanchoo, j. has pointed out, the crucial words in article 16(4), and which form as it were 617 the key to its interpretation, from which the power of the state to make the reservation stems, are that a class of citizens \"is not adequately represented in the services of the state.\" the action permitted to be taken to redress this inadequacy is by reservation of appointments and posts. if by the expression 'posts ' are meant 'posts in the service. itself ' i feel unable to attribute to the expression 'posts ' any special significance beyond an appointment to the service. every appointment in a service must be to \"a post\" in a service, because there cannot be an appointment in the air but can only be to a \"post\" in a service. in that sense, in my view, the expression 'post ' would be really redundant unless, of course, as i have said earlier, it meant not posts in a service but ex cadre posts. there is also one other aspect to which i might advert. in some of the top grades there are single posts in the service. if at any point of time the incumbent is not a member of the backward class, it would certainly be a case of inadequate representation as regards that post which would mean that such posts which are single may be reserved for all time to be held by members of the backward classes, because if at any moment such a person ceases to hold the post there would be inadequate representation in regard to that post. i have drawn attention to this because it pointedly demonstrates that the correct view is that when \"inadequacy of representation\" is referred to in article 16(4) as justifying a reservation, the only rational and reasonable construction of the words are that it refers to a quantitative deficiency in the representation of the backward classes in the service taken as a whole and not to an inadequate representation at each grade of service or in respect of each post in the service. besides, even on the footing that \"posts\" mean posts in the services, article 16(4) properly construed in the light of article 335 of the constitution whose inter. action has been discussed in great detail by wanchoo, j. in the judgment just now pronounced with which entirely agree, contemplates and permits 618 reservation only in respect of appointments to services at the initial stage and not at each stage even after the appointment has taken place. there is one other matter also which i consider relevant in this context. under article 16(4) the state is enabled to make provision for the reservation of appointments if in their opinion certain backward classes of citizens are not adequately represented in the service.", "completion": "if an inadequacy exists today, to give retrospective effect to the reservation, as the impugned notification has done, would be to redress an inadequate representation which took place in the past by an order issued today."}

(which stand for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes) according to percentage basis. the clarification issued was that the said orders did not contemplate such reversion. it was, however, desired that the shortfalls should be made good against the existing as well as the future vacancies. it is by virtue of this clarification that the respondent was assured by the appellants during the proceedings before the high court that he need not entertain any apprehension of reversion as a result of the implementation of the impugned circulars. we would now briefly summarise the findings and conclusions of the high court on the points raised before it by the contentions of the parties in the 595 whether article 16(1) and (2) refer to promotion or whether they are confined to the initial appointment to any post in civil service. in the appeal before us the s, appellants and the respondent both conceded that cases of promotion fell within article 16(1) and (2) though they differed as to whether they were included in article 16(4).", "completion": "it is on these allegations that the respondent prayed for the issue of a writ in the nature of mandamus directing the appellants to forbear from implementing the two impugned circulars.\nthe appellants ' case was that the safeguards provided by article 16(4) would extend not only to initial appointment but also to promotions made by selection and that clearly brought the impugned circulars within the 592 protection of article 16(4).\nthe appellants categorically denied that the respondent would suffer any loss or because persons who had already been promoted on the basis of earlier regular selections were not intended to be reverted as a consequence of the implementation of the impugned circulars.\nthere will be no quota for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes candidates in respect of promotion to 'non selection ' posts.\nthe field of consideration in the case of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes candidates should be four times the number of posts reserved without any condition of qualifying period of service in their case, subject to the condition that consideration should not normally extend to such staff beyond two grades immediately below the grade for which selection is held.\nthus it would be noticed that the effect of this circular was to prescribe a quota of reservation for selection posts and to give effect to this reservation retrospectively from january 4, 593 1957.\nas the board 's orders have retrospective effect from 4th january, 1957, it is necessary that the promotions made in each selection grade on your division/office from 4th january, 1957, are reviewed and the number of posts due to section c.\none of the points thus clarified was whether the instructions issued in the board 's letter contemplated reversion of staff already promoted to selection posts after january 4, 1957, to accommodate section cs."}

on the narrow construction of article 16(1) even if such a dis criminatory course is adopted by the state in respect of its employees that would not be violative of the equality of opportunity guaranteed by article 16(1). such a result could not obviously have been intended by the constitution. in this connection it may be relevant to remember that article 16(1) and (2) really give effect to the equality before law guaranteed by article 14 and to the prohibition of discrimination guaranteed by article 15(1). the three provisions form part of the same constitutional code of guarantees and supplement each other. if that be so, there would be no difficulty in holding that the matters relating to employment must include all matters in relation to employment both prior, and subsequent, to the employment which are incidental to the employment and form part of the terms and conditions of such employment.", "completion": "article 16(1) reads thus: \"there shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the state.\" in deciding the scope and ambit of the fundamental right of equality of opportunity guaranteed by this article it is necessary to bear in mind that in construing the relevant article a technical or pedantic approach must be avoided.\nwhat article 16(1) guarantees is equality of opportunity to all citizens in respect of all the matters relating to employment illustrated by us as well as to an appointment to any office as explained by us.\nany provision as to the qualifications for the employment or the appointment to office reasonably fixed and applicable to all citizens would certainly be consistent with the doctrine of the equality of opportunity; but in regard to employment, like other terms and conditions associated with and incidental to it, the promotion to a selection post is also included in the matters relating to employment, and even in regard to such a promotion to a selection post all that article 16(1) guarantees is equality of opportunity to all citizens who enter service.\n597 if the narrow construction of the expression \"matters relating to employment\" is accepted it would make the fundamental right guaranteed by article 16(1), illusory.\nin that case it would be open to the state ' to comply with the formal requirements of article 16(1) by affording equality of opportunity to all citizens in the matter of initial employment and then to defeated its very aim and object by introducing discriminatory provisions in respect of employees soon after their employment."}

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: it is on, this point that there is a sharp controversy between the parties. before construing article 16(4) it would be convenient to deal with the question as to whether posts specified by it are posts inside the services or outside them. as we have already seen the high court has taken the view that the posts in the context must necessarily mean posts outside the services and that in fact is the sole basis of the decision of the high court against the appellants. the high court has held that the legislative history of the words \"appointments\" and \"posts\" justifies the conclusion that \"posts\" are ex cadre posts. is that really so? in our opinion, the answer to this question must be in the negative. the argument that legislative history about the use of the relevant words is decisively in favour of excluding service posts from the purview of article 16(4) ignores the fact that there can be no legislative history for the provisions of article 16(4) which have found a place in the constitution for the first time. besides, it is not correct to assume that even the legislative history shows that \"posts\" always and inevitably meant posts outside services though it may be conceded that in the majority of corresponding constitutional provisions they do refer to ex service posts. let us look at the relevant provisions of the constitution itself. article 309 empowers the appropriate legislature to regulate the recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to public services and 601 posts in connection with the affairs of the union or of any state. in the context \"posts\" means posts outside services. similarly article 310(1) refers to every person 'who is a member of a defence service or of a civil service of the union or of an all india service or holds any post connected with defence or any civil post under the union. the word \"post\" in the context means an ex cadre post. likewise the expression \"civil post\" in article 311(1) means a civil post outside the services. article 335 to which we have referred uses the word \"posts\" in the same sense. but, when we go to article 336 the word \"posts\" in the context means posts in the services therein enumerated. the position disclosed by the corresponding provisions of the constitution act of 1935 is substantially the same. sections 240 and 241 for instance use the word \"posts\" in the sense of ex service posts; whereas section 246 refers to civil posts in the sense of posts inside the services. in our opinion, it would, therefore, be unreasonable to treat the word \"posts\" as a term of art and to clothe it inexorably with the meaning of excadre posts. it is the context in which the word \"posts\" is used which must determine its denotation. what does the context of article 16(4) indicate? that is the next question which we must consider. article 16(4) clearly shows that the power conferred by it can be exercised in cases where the state is of the opinion that any backward class of citizens is not adequately represented in the services under it. in other words, the opinion formed by the state that the representation available to the backward class of citizens in any of the services is inadequate is a condition precedent for the exercise of the power conferred by article 16(4), and so the power to make reservation as contemplated by article 16(4) can be exercised only to make the inadequate representation in the services adequate. if that be so, both \"appointments\" and \"posts\" to which the operative part of article 16(4) refers and in respect of which the power to make reservation has been conferred on the state must necessarily be appointments and posts in the ser vice. it would be illogical and unreasonable to 602 assume that for making the representation adequate in the services under the state a power should 'be given to the state to reserve posts outside the cadre of services. if the word \"posts\" means excadre posts reservation of such posts cannot possibly cure the imbalance which according to the state is disclosed in the representation in services under it. therefore, in our opinion, the key clause of article 16(4) which prescribes a condition precedent for invoking the power conferred by it itself unambiguously indicates that the word \"posts\" cannot mean ex cadre posts in the context. in fairness to mr. kumaramangalam, who appeared for the respondent, we ought to add that he did not resist the contention of mr. chatterjee, for the appellants, that the context requires that \"posts\" should be deemed to be posts inside services and not outside them. therefore, the main, if not the sole, reason given by the high court in support of its conclusion does not appear to us to be well founded, and so article 16(4) must be construed on the basis that both \"appointments\" and \"posts\" to which its operative clause refers are appointments and posts in the services under the state. incidentally, we may repeat what we have already pointed out that the tenor of the judgment under appeal shows that if the high court had construed the word \"posts\" as posts inside the services it would not have issued the writ in favour of the respondent. having in substance conceded that \"posts\" does not mean posts outside services mr. kumaramangalam presented a very plausible argument in support of his case that the impugned circulars fall outside article 16(4). he contends that the key clause on which mr.", "completion": "before construing article 16(4) it would be convenient to deal with the question as to whether posts specified by it are posts inside the services or outside them.\nthe argument that legislative history about the use of the relevant words is decisively in favour of excluding service posts from the purview of article 16(4) ignores the fact that there can be no legislative history for the provisions of article 16(4) which have found a place in the constitution for the first time.\nin the context \"posts\" means posts outside services.\nlikewise the expression \"civil post\" in article 311(1) means a civil post outside the services.\nbut, when we go to article 336 the word \"posts\" in the context means posts in the services therein enumerated.\ntherefore, in our opinion, the key clause of article 16(4) which prescribes a condition precedent for invoking the power conferred by it itself unambiguously indicates that the word \"posts\" cannot mean ex cadre posts in the context.\ntherefore, the main, if not the sole, reason given by the high court in support of its conclusion does not appear to us to be well founded, and so article 16(4) must be construed on the basis that both \"appointments\" and \"posts\" to which its operative clause refers are appointments and posts in the services under the state."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: chatterjee relies in construing the word \"posts\" as meaning posts in the services itself shows that direct promotion to selection posts by reservation is not permissible under article 16(4). his argument is that if it is discovered that any backward class of citizens is not adequately represented in the services under the state the state may no doubt seek to introduce the balance by giving adequate representation to the backward class by making reservations for initial 603 appointments. it may decide the proportion of the said reservation in order to introduce the balance and then give effect to it by making adequate number of appointments by reservation at the initial stage. if ' this process by itself appears to the state to be slow and tardy it may even reserve selection posts but this reservation can be given effect to again by promoting( suitable backward candidates to the said posts after they fall vacant and making a proportionately larger number of appointments at the initial stage. in any case reservation must work from the bottom and reservation cannot be permitted to allow direct appointment to selection posts as the impugned circulars seek to do. it may be conceded that reservation of appointments or posts maybe made in the manner suggested by mr. kumaramangalam. it may also be assumed that giving retrospective effect to reservations may well cause heart burning or dissatisfaction amongst the general class of employees and in that sense it would be an act of wisdom not to give effect to reservation retrospectively. but, with the propriety or the wisdom of the policy underlying the circulars we are not directly concerned. even if it be assumed that it would be open to the state to adopt the method suggested by mr. kumaramangalam to give effect to the power of reservation in order to make the representation of the backward classes adequate in its services does it follow that it is the only method permissible under article 16(4)? we are inclined to hold that the answer to this question cannot be in favour of the respondent. if it is conceded that selection posts can be reserved it is difficult to see how it would be open to the respondent to contend that these reserved selection posts must be filled only prospectively and not retrospectively. the concession that selection posts can be reserved on which the argument is based itself provides the answer to the argument that if the said posts can be reserved the reserved posts can be filled either prospectively or retrospectively. in adopting the latter course there can be no violation of the constitutional provision contained in article 16(4). 604 the condition precedent for the exercise of the powers conferred by article 16(4) is that the state ought to be satisfied that any backward class of citizens is not adequately represented in its services. this condition precedent may refer either to the numerical inadequacy of representation in the services or even to the qualitative inadequacy of representation. the advancement of the socially and educationally backward classes requires not only that they should have adequate representation in the lowest rung of services but that they should aspire to secure adequate representation in selection posts in the services as well. in the context the expression 'adequately represented ' imports considerations of \"size\" as well as \"values\", numbers as well as the nature of appointments held and so it involves not merely the numerical test but also the qualitative one. it is thus by the operation of the numerical and a qualitative test that the adequacy or otherwise of the representation of backward classes in any service has to be judged; and if that be so, it would not be reasonable to hold that the inadequacy of representation can and must be cured only by reserving a proportionately higher percentage of appointments at the initial stage. in a given case the state may well take the view that a certain percentage of selection posts should also be reserved, for reservation of such posts may make the representation of backward classes in the services adequate, the adequacy of such representation being considered qualitatively. if it is conceded that \"posts\" in the context refer to posts in the services and that selection posts may be reserved but should be filled only in the manner suggested by the respondent then we see no reason for holding that the reservation of selection posts cannot be implemented by promoting suitable members of backward class of citizens to such posts as the circulars intend to do. we must in this connection consider an alternative argument that the word \"posts\" must refer not to 605 selection posts but to posts filled by initial appointments. on this argument reservation of appointments means reservation of certain percentage in the initial appointments and reservation of posts means reservation of initial posts which may be adopted in order to expedite and make more effective the reservation of appointments themselves. on this construction the use of the word \"posts\" appears to be wholly redundant. in our opinion, having regard to the fact that we are construing the relevant expression \"reservation of appointments\" in a constitutional provision it would be unreasonable to assume that the reservation of appointments would not include both the methods of reservation, namely, reservation of appointments by fixing a certain percentage in that behalf as well as reservation of certain initial posts in order to make the reservation of appointments more effective. that being so, this alternative argument which confines the word \"posts\" to initial posts seems to us to be entirely unreasonable.", "completion": "his argument is that if it is discovered that any backward class of citizens is not adequately represented in the services under the state the state may no doubt seek to introduce the balance by giving adequate representation to the backward class by making reservations for initial 603 appointments.\nif ' this process by itself appears to the state to be slow and tardy it may even reserve selection posts but this reservation can be given effect to again by promoting( suitable backward candidates to the said posts after they fall vacant and making a proportionately larger number of appointments at the initial stage.\nkumaramangalam to give effect to the power of reservation in order to make the representation of the backward classes adequate in its services does it follow that it is the only method permissible under article 16(4)?\nin a given case the state may well take the view that a certain percentage of selection posts should also be reserved, for reservation of such posts may make the representation of backward classes in the services adequate, the adequacy of such representation being considered qualitatively.\nif it is conceded that \"posts\" in the context refer to posts in the services and that selection posts may be reserved but should be filled only in the manner suggested by the respondent then we see no reason for holding that the reservation of selection posts cannot be implemented by promoting suitable members of backward class of citizens to such posts as the circulars intend to do."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: on the other hand, under the construction by which the word \"posts\" includes selection posts the use of the word \"posts\" is not superfluous but serves a very important purpose. it shows that reservation can be made not only in regard to appointments which are initial appointments but also in regard to selection posts which may fall to be filled by employees after their employment. this construction has the merit of interpreting the words \"appointments\" and \"posts\" in their broad and liberal sense and giving effect to the policy which is obviously the basis of the provisions of article 16(4). therefore, we are disposed to take the view that the power of reservation which is conferred on the state under article 16(4) can be exercised by the state in a proper case not only by providing for reservation of appointments but also by providing for reservation of selection posts. this construction, in our opinion, would serve to give effect to the intention of the constitution makers to make adequate safeguard for the advancement of backward classes and to secure for their adequate representation in the services. our 77 06 conclusion, therefore, is that the high court was in error in holding that the impugned circulars do not all within article 16(4). it is true that in providing for the reservation of appointments or posts under article 16(4) the state has to take into consideration the claims of the members of the backward classes consistently with the maintenance of the efficiency of administration. it must not be forgotten that the efficiency of administration is of such paramount importance that it would be unwise and impermissible to make any reservation at the cost of efficiency of administration. that undoubtedly is the effect of article 335. reservation of appointments or posts may theoretically and conceivably mean some impairment of efficiency; but the risk involved in sacrificing efficiency of administration must always be borne in mind when any state sets about making a provision for reservation of appointments or posts. it is also true that the reservation which can be made under article 16(4) is intended merely to give adequate representation to backward communities. it cannot be used for creating monopolies or for unduly or illegitimately disturbing the legitimate interests of other employees. in exercising the powers under article 16(4) the problem of adequate representation of the backward class of citizens must be fairly and objectively considered and an attempt must always be made to strike a reasonable balance between the claims of backward classes and the claims of other employees as well as the important consideration of the efficiency of administration; but, in the present case, as we have already seen ' the challenge to the validity of the impugned circulars is based on the assumption that the said circulars are outside article 16(4) because the posts referred to in the said article are posts outside the cadre of services and in any case, do not include selection posts. since, in our opinion, this assumption is not well founded we must hold that the impugned circulars are not unconstitutional. in the result the decision of the high court under appeal is reversed and the respondent 's application 607 for a writ is dismissed. there would be no order as to costs. wanchoo, j. i have read the judgment just delivered by my learned brother gajendragadkar j., and i agree with him as to the scope of article 16(1) of the constitution. i also agree with him that the scheduled castes and the scheduled tribes are included in the words \"backward class of citizens\" in article 16(4) and that the word \"posts\" in that article refers to posts in the services and not to posts outside the services. i regret however that i have not been able to persuade myself that article 16(4) permits reservation even in grades within a particular service in case the service has various grades in its cadre, and proceed to give my reasons for the same. before i construe the words of article 16(4), i may state that i am not unmindful of the fact that article 16(4) is a constitutional provision and that constitutional provisions are not to be interpreted in any narrow or pedantic sense. at the same time it cannot be forgotten that article 16(4) is in the nature of an exception or a proviso to article 16(1), which is a fundamental right providing equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the state. this aspect of article 16(4) in my opinion inevitably requires that the proviso or the exception should not be interpreted so liberally as to destroy the fundamental right itself to which it is a proviso or exception. the construction therefore of article 16(4) cannot ignore this aspect of the matter. i now read article 16(4): \"nothing in this article shall prevent the state from making any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which, in the opinion of the state, is not adequately represented in the services under the state. \" before i turn to the actual words used in the article i must refer to what i consider is implicit in that article. the article provides for reservation of 608 appointments or posts and it seems tome obvious that it is implicit in the article that the reservation of appointments or posts cannot go to the length of reserving all appointments or posts or even to the length of reserving a majority of them.", "completion": "this construction has the merit of interpreting the words \"appointments\" and \"posts\" in their broad and liberal sense and giving effect to the policy which is obviously the basis of the provisions of article 16(4).\ntherefore, we are disposed to take the view that the power of reservation which is conferred on the state under article 16(4) can be exercised by the state in a proper case not only by providing for reservation of appointments but also by providing for reservation of selection posts.\nit is true that in providing for the reservation of appointments or posts under article 16(4) the state has to take into consideration the claims of the members of the backward classes consistently with the maintenance of the efficiency of administration.\nin exercising the powers under article 16(4) the problem of adequate representation of the backward class of citizens must be fairly and objectively considered and an attempt must always be made to strike a reasonable balance between the claims of backward classes and the claims of other employees as well as the important consideration of the efficiency of administration;

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: the reason why i say that all appointments or posts cannot be reserved under article 16(4) (though that would be the result if the widest possible interpretation is given to the words used in the article) is that if all appointments or posts could be reserved under article 16(4) it would mean complete destruction of the fundamental right guaranteed under article 16(1). it could not be the intention of the constitution makers that the proviso or exception in article 16(4) should be so used as to destroy completely the fundamental right enshrined in article 16(1). nor do i think that it is permissible under article 16(4) to reserve a majority of appointments or posts, for that again, in my opinion, though it may not completely destroy the fundamental right guaranteed under article 16(1) will certainly make it practically illusory. again it could not be the intention of the constitution makers that article 16(4) should be so interpreted as to make the fundamental right guaranteed under article 16(1) illusory. i may in this connection refer to article 335, which occurs in part xvi dealing with special provisions relating to certain classes, which reinforces what i have said above. that article provides that \"the claims of the members of the scheduled castes and the scheduled tribes shall be taken into consideration, consistently with the maintenance of efficiency of administration, in the making of appointments to services and posts in connection with the affairs of the union or of a state.\" now the scheduled tribes and the scheduled castes are included in the words \"backward class of citizens\" used in article 16(4). therefore in considering the claims of, at any rate, a part of, those included in article 16(4) (and i presume the same will apply to the whole) the maintenance of efficiency of administration must be kept in mind, for the reservation provided in article 16(4) is to meet the claims of the members of the 609 scheduled castes and the scheduled tribes. reservation, therefore, of all appointments or posts or even a majority of them is certain to result in the impairment of efficiency of administration and therefore what i consider as implicit in article 16(4) is borne out also by the provision in article 335. it is in this background that the interpretation of article 16(4) falls to be considered. turning now to the words in article 16(4), it appears to me that the key words in that article are \"not adequately represented in the services under the state.\" obviously, reservation can be made under this article only if the state comes to the conclusion that any backward class of citizens is not adequately represented in the services under it. if, for example, the state is of opinion that backward classes are adequately represented in the services it can make no reservation under article 16(4). what then is the meaning of these key words in this article? what these words require is that reservation may be made in order to make the representation of any backward class of citizens adequate in the services. does the word \"adequate\" imply only numerical representation in the services or does it imply something more than that? the three meanings of the word \"adequate\" given in the shorter oxford english dictionary are (i) equal in magnitude and extent; (ii) commensurate in fitness, sufficient, suitable; and (iii) fully representing (logic). it seems to me that it is the second meaning (namely, sufficient) which properly applies to the words \"adequately represented\" as used in this article. \"sufficient\" has two meanings: (i) sufficing, adequate, esp. in amount or number to the need, (ii) enough, adequate quantity. therefore, when article 16(4) says that reservation may be made in order that any backward class of citizens may be adequately represented in the services it means that reservation may be made in order to make the number of any backward class sufficient in the services under the state. these words do not in my opinion convey any idea of quality and can only mean sufficient quantitative representation in the services under the state. if 610 the intention of the constitution makers was that there may also be reservation in various grades in a particular service where there are grades in the ser vice, i should have expected different words being used in article 16(4) to convey that meaning. these key words used in this article further convey the idea of representation in the services as a whole, for there are no words which suggest that the service should be broken up in case there are grades in it for the purposes of adequate representation. the conclusion therefore at which i arrive is that these key words convey the idea of adequate numerical representation for any backward class of citizens in a particular service as a whole and it is for this purpose alone that reservation can be made of appointments or posts in the services. this brings me to the question as to bow the reservation is to be made. article 16(4) tells us that it may be made either by reserving appointments to the services or reserving posts in the services. appointments in my opinion clearly mean the initial appointments to a service, for a person is appointed only once in a service and thereafter there is no further appointment. therefore, when the article speaks of reservation of appointments it means reservation of a per centage of initial appointments to the service. posts refer to the total number of posts in the service and when reservation is by reference to posts it means reservation of a certain percentage of posts out of the total number of posts in the service.", "completion": "that article provides that \"the claims of the members of the scheduled castes and the scheduled tribes shall be taken into consideration, consistently with the maintenance of efficiency of administration, in the making of appointments to services and posts in connection with the affairs of the union or of a state.\" now the scheduled tribes and the scheduled castes are included in the words \"backward class of citizens\" used in article 16(4).\nturning now to the words in article 16(4), it appears to me that the key words in that article are \"not adequately represented in the services under the state.\" obviously, reservation can be made under this article only if the state comes to the conclusion that any backward class of citizens is not adequately represented in the services under it.\nif, for example, the state is of opinion that backward classes are adequately represented in the services it can make no reservation under article 16(4).\ntherefore, when article 16(4) says that reservation may be made in order that any backward class of citizens may be adequately represented in the services it means that reservation may be made in order to make the number of any backward class sufficient in the services under the state.\nthe conclusion therefore at which i arrive is that these key words convey the idea of adequate numerical representation for any backward class of citizens in a particular service as a whole and it is for this purpose alone that reservation can be made of appointments or posts in the services."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: the reason why these two methods are mentioned in this article is also to my mind plain. the method of reservation of appointments would mean that the goal of adequate representation may be reached in a long time. therefore, in order that the goal. may be reached in a comparatively shorter period of time, the article also provides for the method of reservation of posts. this will be clear from an example which i may give. suppose there are 1,000 posts in a particular service and the backward classes have no representation at all in that service. the state considers it necessary that they should have adequate representation in that 611 service. suppose also that the annual appointments to be made to the service in order to keep it at full strength is thirty. now the state if it chooses the method of reservation of appointments will reserve a percentage of appointments each year for backward classes. now suppose that percentage is fixed at ten per century. in order therefore to reach the ten per centum of the total number of posts in the service by the method of reservation of appointments, the period taken would be roughly 34 years. this period may be considered too long and therefore the state may decide to adopt the other way, i.e., the reserva tion of posts; and suppose it is decided to reserve ten per centum of the posts, i.e., 100 in all. it will then be open to the state having reserved 100 posts in this particular service for backward classes to say that till these 100 posts are filled up by backward classes all appointments will go to them provided the minimum qualifications that may be prescribed are fulfilled. suppose further that it is possible to get annually the requisite number of qualified members of backward classes equal to the annual appointments, the representation of the backward classes will be made adequate in about four years. once the representation is adequate there will be no power left for making further reservation. thus by the method of reserva tion of appointments the representation is made adequate in a long period of time while by the method of reserving posts the representation is made adequate in a much shorter period. that seems to be the reason why the article speaks of reservation of appointments as well as of posts. it is however said that this construction of article 16(4) makes the use of the word \"posts\" therein superfluous, and that the same result of making the representation adequate quickly could have been achieved if the word \"appointments\" only had been used therein. i am of opinion that this is not so and the use of the word \"appointments\" only in article 16(4) would not have made it possible for the state to make the representation of backward classes adequate in a short space of time. in the example i have given the 612 representation of backward classes was made adequate in four years by the method of reservation of posts; it would however not have been possible to make the representation adequate in this hypothetical case in such a short time if the article only provided for reservation of appointments. i have already said that it is implicit in the article that reservation cannot be of all appointments or even of a majority of them, for that would completely destroy the fundamental right enshrined in article 16(1) to which article 16(4) is in the nature of a proviso or an exception or at any rate make it practically illusory. therefore, it would not be open to the state to reserve all or even a majority of the appointments for backward classes, if the word \"appointments\" only had been used in article 16(4). even if a larger percentage than ten per centum were reserved for backward classes in the matter of appointments in the hypothetical case given by me it would not be possible to reach the total of 100 posts for the backward classes in the service in less than twice or thrice the time taken by the method of reservation of posts, for the state could not reserve all or even the majority of appointments in any particular year, in view of what is implicit in article 16(4), if the word \" a appointments\" only had been there. it seems to me therefore that the use of the word \"posts\" in that article was with a purpose, namely, that by the method of reservation of posts the inadequate representation may be made adequate within a short space of time and the objection that could be raised to the reservation of all appointments, if only the word \"appointments\" had been used in the article, would no longer be available. it cannot therefore be said that on the interpretation i have placed on article 16(4) the use of the word \"posts\" therein becomes superfluous. i have already said that if the intention was not only to make reservation in the service as a whole whether by the method of reserving appointments or by the method of reserving posts but also to include reservation in various grades in which a service may be divided, the words of article 16(4) would have been different. i may in this connection refer to article 335 613 again, which lays down that the claims of the scheduled castes and the scheduled tribes (which are part of backward classes of citizens) shall be considered so,. , consistently with the maintenance of efficiency of administration.", "completion": "thus by the method of reserva tion of appointments the representation is made adequate in a long period of time while by the method of reserving posts the representation is made adequate in a much shorter period.\ni am of opinion that this is not so and the use of the word \"appointments\" only in article 16(4) would not have made it possible for the state to make the representation of backward classes adequate in a short space of time.\nin the example i have given the 612 representation of backward classes was made adequate in four years by the method of reservation of posts;

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: the decisions of different high courts bearing on this point show that the learned judges did not always try so much to construe the terms of the relevant constitutional provision as to reconcile their earlier decisions which disclosed a different approach and a tendency to reach different conclusions. indeed, on occasions some judgments have expressed the hope that the sharp conflict of judicial opinion resulting from the difference in approach adopted in dealing with the problem can be effectively resolved only when this court considers the matter and makes its authoritative pronouncement. thus it would be clear that though this important question lies within a narrow compass it is not free from difficulty. in dealing with this question we think the best course to adopt would be to consider the problem of construction without reference to the previous decisions on the point, and in construing the relevant clause it is obviously necessary to bear in mind that the clause under discussion deals with the constitutional right of the litigant to make an appeal to this court; and so it would be inappropriate to adopt a 457 technical or pedantic approach in interpreting the material words used in the relevant clause. reading the clause as a whole and giving the material words their plain grammatical meaning it seems prima facie to show that the test of affirmance prescribed by the clause can best be satisfied if we take the appellate decree in its entirety and enquire whether the said decree affirms the decision of the trial court considered, in its entirety. it is a matter of comparing the appellate decree with the decision of the trial court under appeal. if the appellate decree affirms the decree of the trial court it is a decree of affirmance; if there is a variation made by the appellate decree in the decision of the trial court the appellate decree is not a decree of affirmance and this position would not be affected whether the variation is made in favour of the intending appellant or against him and whether the variation made is minor or major. it is, however, urged that the words \"judgment, decree or final order appealed from\" denote that part of the judgment, decree or final order in appeal which is intended to be challenged in the proposed appeal to this court. in other words, the word \"decree\" it is suggested, refers to the part of the decree under appeal. on this construction a decree has to be split up into different parts and the words \"appealed from\" have to be treated as words of limitation. the argument in a slightly different form has also been pressed before us. it is suggested that in cases where different causes of action and different claims and reliefs have been combined different decrees are in fact passed though in form there may be one paper on which one decree is drawn; and so it is argued that the decree appealed from must mean the decree under appeal dealing with the subject matter or matter in dispute proposed to be brought to this court by the intending appellant. for one thing this argument may not be available where there is only one cause of action, and it is quite clear that the word \"decree\" must have one meaning applicable to all cases. besides, in our opinion, this construction on which the argument is based is far too technical and artificial and cannot be 458 regarded as reasonable. normally, in each suit there is one decree, and so it would be inconsistent with the scheme of the code to divide the decree into several parts by reference to its relation to different claims or subject matters or to treat one single decree as consisting in fact of several decrees. the normal, natural and reasonable construction to place on the first part of the relevant clause is to hold that it refers not merely to that part of the decree which is sought to be challenged in the appeal but the entire decree from which the appeal arises or the decree giving rise to the appeal. on this construction the clause \"appealed from\" is not a clause of limitation. it is merely a descriptive clause and it describes the decree as one from which the appeal arises. if that be so, in deter mining the character of the decree it would be necessary to take the decree as a whole and enquire whether it is a decree of affirmance or not. in support of the argument that there can be more decrees than one in a suit which combines different causes of action and different claims made against different defendants in respect of different subject matters mr. tatachari, for the respondent, has relied on the decision of the calcutta high court in dhirendra nath sarkar vs nischintapore company (1). in that case the court was dealing with a decree which was made in favour of the plaintiffs for the recovery of arrears of rent in respect of three tenancies held by three different tenants and the question raised was one of limitation under article 182, cl. (5) of the limitation act (ix of 1908). the court held that although the decree was passed in one suit and was set out on one sheet of paper the position was precisely the same as if the plaintiffs had brought three distinct suits against the defendants and had obtained three different decrees.", "completion": "in dealing with this question we think the best course to adopt would be to consider the problem of construction without reference to the previous decisions on the point, and in construing the relevant clause it is obviously necessary to bear in mind that the clause under discussion deals with the constitutional right of the litigant to make an appeal to this court; and so it would be inappropriate to adopt a 457 technical or pedantic approach in interpreting the material words used in the relevant clause.\nit is a matter of comparing the appellate decree with the decision of the trial court under appeal.\non this construction a decree has to be split up into different parts and the words \"appealed from\" have to be treated as words of limitation.\nit is suggested that in cases where different causes of action and different claims and reliefs have been combined different decrees are in fact passed though in form there may be one paper on which one decree is drawn; and so it is argued that the decree appealed from must mean the decree under appeal dealing with the subject matter or matter in dispute proposed to be brought to this court by the intending appellant."}

(5) of article 182 shall take effect in favour only of such of the said persons or their representatives as it may be made by. but where the decree or order has been passed jointly in favour of more persons than one, such application, if made by any one or more of them, or by his or their representative, shall take effect in favour of them all. the facts in the case of dhirendra nath sarkar (1) were converse of the case contemplated by the first part of explanation (1), and so the principle laid down by the said part of explanation (1) was applied and it was held that in respect of the two tenancies the decree holder 's application for execution was barred by article 182, cl. it would be idle to contend that considerations which are relevant and material under explanation (1) are of such a general application as to support the plea that in a suit where different causes of action are included and different reliefs are claimed against different individuals several decrees are passed and not one. there are cases in which more than one decree can be and are passed under the code of civil procedure, for instance cases where preliminary decrees are passed, but the normal rule is one decree is passed in one suit and so we are not prepared to accede to the argument that the first part of the relevant clause of article 133(1) should be read on the basis that every decree passed in a suit should be held to be a (1) ; 22 c.w.n. 192. 460 composite decree made up of several decrees in respect of several claims or reliefs and that the decree appealed from is only that particular decree which is proposed to be brought in appeal to this court. the next question to consider is: what is the denotation of the word \"decision\" used in the said clause. the argument for the respondent is that the word \"decision\" does not mean the whole of the decision but the decision on that part of the controversy between the parties which is brought to this court in appeal. in support of the argument that the decision does not mean the entire decision of the trial court reliance is placed on the provisions of o. 20, rr. 4 and 5. rule 4 of o. 20 deals with the judgments of small cause courts and judgments of other courts, and it provides that the judgments falling under the first clause need not contain more than the points for determination and decision thereon, whereas the judgments falling under the latter class should contain a concise statement of the case, the points for determination, the decision thereon and the reasons for such decision. there is no doubt that the decision in the context means the decision on the points for determination. that of course is the meaning of the word \"decision\", but whether or not the word \"decision\" means the decision on one point or the decision of the whole suit comprising of all the points in dispute between the parties must inevitably depend upon the context, and the context is plainly inconsistent with the argument that the decision should mean the decision on a specific point. if the word \"decree\" in the first part of the relevant clause means not a part of the decree but the whole of the decree then it would be reasonable to hold that the word \"decision\" must likewise mean the entire decision of the trial court and not a part of it. then it is urged that o. 41, r. 33 seems to contemplate that there can be an appeal against a part only of the decree and so the word \"decree\" in the first part of the relevant clause may well mean a part of the decree under appeal.", "completion": "this argument was rejected and it was held that under explanation (1) to article 182 the decree holder 's application for execution was barred by limitation in respect of the said two tenancies.\nthe facts in the case of dhirendra nath sarkar (1) were converse of the case contemplated by the first part of explanation (1), and so the principle laid down by the said part of explanation (1) was applied and it was held that in respect of the two tenancies the decree holder 's application for execution was barred by article 182, cl.\nthere are cases in which more than one decree can be and are passed under the code of civil procedure, for instance cases where preliminary decrees are passed, but the normal rule is one decree is passed in one suit and so we are not prepared to accede to the argument that the first part of the relevant clause of article 133(1) should be read on the basis that every decree passed in a suit should be held to be a (1) ; 22 c.w.n. 192.\nif the word \"decree\" in the first part of the relevant clause means not a part of the decree but the whole of the decree then it would be reasonable to hold that the word \"decision\" must likewise mean the entire decision of the trial court and not a part of it."}

in the result it was held that the appellate decree which confirmed the decision of the trial court though on different grounds was in law a decree of affirmance. it would thus be seen that this decision undoubtedly supports the conclusion that the word \"decision\" in article 133(1) should mean not a part of the decision or the grounds given for it but the decision of the suit as a whole;

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: there is yet another argument which must be examined, it is contended that the adoption of the literal construction of the relevant clause relating to affirmance would lead to anamolous and unreasonable consequences. it is pointed out that if the decision of the trial court is wholly confirmed the intending appellant would not be entitled to come to this court as a matter of right unless there is a substantial question of law. on the literal construction, however, he would be entitled to come to this court even if there is a very minor and slight modification in the decision of the trial court and that too in his favour. prima facie it may no doubt seem somewhat unreasonable that even a slight modification made in the decision should give the intending appellant the right to come to this court; but, on the other hand, even this position cannot be regarded as unreasonable because it would really be found to be consistent with the principle underlying the doctrine of affirmance. what is the basic idea underlying the relevant provision? if two courts which have judged the dispute between the parties and applied their independent minds to it agree in their conclusions the appellate decision is one of affirmance and unless there is a substantial question of law no further right to appeal should lie. that is the basis of the provision. when, however, a variation is made by the appellate court it tends to 464 show that the two courts have not entirely agreed and so it is not a case of affirmance. the extent of the difference does not matter so much as the fact that there is a difference in the result, and go in prescribing the doctrine of affirmance the constitution makers may well have intended that the said doctrine should be confined only to cases where there is a complete affirmance and not to cases of partial affirmance. we do not think that the consequence of the view we are inclined to take can be reasonably charac terised as opposed to common sense. besides, if on a fair and reasonable construction the words used in the relevant clause lead to the conclusion which we are inclined to draw it would be unreasonable to limit the scope of the said words on hypothetical considerations of unreasonable consequences. as we have already observed we are dealing with a constitutional right conferred on litigants, and, unless the limitation contended for by the respondent can be said to flow reasonably from the words used in the relevant clause, it would not be open to us to adopt that limited construction merely on such hypothetical considerations. then it is urged that the majority of the high courts in india have taken the same view which the madras high court has taken in the present case and so we should be slow to interfere with the majority decision. in support of this conclusion the principle of stare decisis is pressed into service. we are not impressed by this argument. it is perfectly true that in construing the clause we would carefully have to bear in mind the views expressed by the majority of our high courts, but as we have already indicated there is a sharp conflict of opinion on this point and it can be stated generally that in almost all the high. courts different views have been expressed at one time or the other. besides, it would be singularly inappropriate to invoke the doctrine of stare decisis in a case of this kind where high courts have differed and the matter has been brought to this court for resolving the said difference of opinion. in such a case it is open to us, and indeed it is our duty, to construe the relevant clause and decide which of the two 465 conflicting views should hereafter prevail. therefore the argument based on the practice prevailing in the majority of the high courts in this country is not of much assistance. at this stage we may deal with another argument urged by mr. rama reddy who appeared for some of the respondents. he contends that in construing the relevant clause we may have regard to the fact that, the constitution intended to restrict the right of the ' appellant to come to this court and not to widen it. in support of this argument be relies on the fact that the value of the subject matter prescribed by article 133(1)(a) is now made rs. 20,000 whereas formerly it was rs. 10,000, and he also relies on the provisions of article 133(3) under which no appeal shall lie to the supreme court from the judgment, decree or final order of one judge of a high court. in our opinion, there is no substance in this contention. it is well known that in raising the amount of the value of the subject matter article 133 (1) (a) has merely partially recognised the fall in the price of the rupee and so it cannot be read as showing the intention to restrict the appellant 's right in any manner. in regard to the provisions of article 133(3) there is no material change made by the constitution since the position under section iii of the code of 1908 as well as section 597 of the code of 1882 was substantially the same. we would accordingly hold that in determining the question as to whether the appellate decree passed by the high court affirmed the decision of the trial court the appellate decree must be considered as a whole in relation to the decision of the trial court similarly considered as a whole.", "completion": "it is pointed out that if the decision of the trial court is wholly confirmed the intending appellant would not be entitled to come to this court as a matter of right unless there is a substantial question of law.\nprima facie it may no doubt seem somewhat unreasonable that even a slight modification made in the decision should give the intending appellant the right to come to this court;

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: that is the proper approach in applying the test of affirmance. if there is a variation made in the appellate decree in the decision of the trial court it is not a decree of affirmance and this is not affected either by the extent of the variation made or by the fact that the variation is made in favour of the intending appellant and not against him. in this connection it would be interesting to refer to three decisions which afford judicial background for 466 the controversy that has been agitated in the several high courts for so many years past. in raja sree nath roy bahadur vs the secretary of state for india in council (1) a full bench of the calcutta high court had occasion to consider the effect of the relevant provisions of section 596 of the code of 1882. in a land acquisition case the applicant had claimed a sum of rs. 77,000 odd as the value of his land. the collector had assessed the value at rs. 28,287. on a reference the judge upheld the collector 's award. the applicant then moved the high court by appeal and in his appeal he valued his claim at rs. 49,000. the high court partially allowed the appeal and granted him an additional sum of rs. 7,000. the applicant then applied for leave to appeal to the privy council and urged that the decree passed by the high court on appeal was not a decree of affirmance and since the test of the value of the subject matter was satisfied be was entitled to go to the privy council. this application was rejected by the high court. \"the appellant desires\", observed maclean, c. j., \"to appeal only against the decision of this court so far as it affirmed the decision of the court below, nothing else. this seems to be, in substance, as far as the subject of the appeal goes, a decree of affirmance\". the learned chief justice also added that whilst the decree of the high court modified in the petitioner 's favour the original decree, as regards the subject matter of the proposed appeal to his majesty in council it most certainly affirmed the decree of the first court. this judgment was pronounced in 1904; and the construction which it put on the relevant clause of section 596 is in conformity with the views for which the respondents contend in the present appeal. the same point was raised before the privy council in annapurnabai vs ruprao (2). in that case the plaintiff who claimed to have been adopted by the senior widow of shanker rao sued the junior widow of shanker rao (defendant 1) as well as the person who claimed to have been adopted by her (defendant 2) for possession of half the property of shanker rao. (1) (2) (1924) l.r. 51 i.a. 319. 467 both the defendants denied the plaintiff 's adoption land set up the adoption of defendant 2. the trial court held that the plaintiff 's adoption had been proved and that the alleged adoption of defendant 2 had not been proved. it, however, found that the plaintiff was bound to provide maintenance for defendant i at the rate of rs. 800 per annum. defendant i had in that behalf claimed rs., 3,000 per annum for( her maintenance out of the estate. upon appeal by the defendants to the court of the judicial commissioner the trial court 's decree was modified by increasing the maintenance from rs. 800 to rs. 1,200 per annum. in other respects the decree was affirmed. the defendants then applied to the court of the judicial commissioner for leave to appeal to the privy council. their argument that they were entitled to appeal to the privy council was rejected on the ground that the appellate decree was one of affirmance, and that a small change made by it in favour of the defendants did not affect that position. it was this decision which was challenged before the privy council. lord dunedin, who delivered a very short judgment on behalf of the board, stated that in the opinion of their lordships the contention of the petitioners ' coun sel as to the effect of section 110 of the code of civil proce dure is correct, and the petitioners had a right of appeal. in other words, this decision clearly shows that though the trial court 's decision had been varied to some extent in favour of the intending appellants it was held that the appellate decree was not one of affirmance and so the intending appellants were entitled to obtain leave to appeal to the privy council. it does appear that the appellants in that case confined their appeal only to the amount of maintenance having regard to the concurrent findings made by the courts below in respect of other matters; and so the special leave granted to them was limited to the question of the said maintenance allowance. that, however, had nothing to do with the decision of the privy council as to the character of the appellate decree. the appellants did not want to agitate the other points and asked for permission to limit their appeal only to 468 the question of their maintenance; that is about all. thus it is clear that the decision of the privy council in that case construed the relevant provisions of section 110 literally and held that if the appellate decree makes any variation in the decision of the trial court may be in favour of the intending appellant it is not a decree of affirmance and the intending appellant was entitled to go to the privy council in appeal.", "completion": "the applicant then applied for leave to appeal to the privy council and urged that the decree passed by the high court on appeal was not a decree of affirmance and since the test of the value of the subject matter was satisfied be was entitled to go to the privy council.\nthe learned chief justice also added that whilst the decree of the high court modified in the petitioner 's favour the original decree, as regards the subject matter of the proposed appeal to his majesty in council it most certainly affirmed the decree of the first court.\nupon appeal by the defendants to the court of the judicial commissioner the trial court 's decree was modified by increasing the maintenance from rs.\nthe defendants then applied to the court of the judicial commissioner for leave to appeal to the privy council.\ntheir argument that they were entitled to appeal to the privy council was rejected on the ground that the appellate decree was one of affirmance, and that a small change made by it in favour of the defendants did not affect that position.\nin other words, this decision clearly shows that though the trial court 's decision had been varied to some extent in favour of the intending appellants it was held that the appellate decree was not one of affirmance and so the intending appellants were entitled to obtain leave to appeal to the privy council.\nthus it is clear that the decision of the privy council in that case construed the relevant provisions of section 110 literally and held that if the appellate decree makes any variation in the decision of the trial court may be in favour of the intending appellant it is not a decree of affirmance and the intending appellant was entitled to go to the privy council in appeal."}

going further than this that where there is a dispute as to the amount of decree or as to the amount of damages the reasoning of raja sree nath roy 's case (2) is not a correct application of that principle\". \"we may take it\", said the learned chief justice, \"that where the amount is a question in dispute the fact that the courts differ and that the higher court differs in favour of the applicant does not mean that the decision is one of affirmance, but i am not, in a case of this kind, prepared to say that because on a totally different point, namely, a point about the share, the applicant has succeeded and succeeded altogether so that he has no further grievance in that matter, he can without showing a substantial question of law have a right to litigate upon other points upon which both the courts have been in agreement\". it is the interpretation thus put by chief justice rankin on the decision in the case of annapurnabai (1) that subsequently became the starting point of elaborate discussion in which legal subtlety was pressed into service and distinction was made between action arising on a single cause of action and giving rise to a single claim and actions in which different causes of actions were combined against different persons and different reliefs were claimed. as we have just indicated, the learned chief justice undoubtedly entertained a doubt as to the correctness of the test of substance which was then applied by some of the high (1) (1924) l.r. 51 i.a. 319 (2) 60 417o courts in interpreting the provisions of section 110 of the code. one feels tempted to observe with respect that if the learned chief justice had examined the question of construction afresh without reference to the prevailing practice or the decisions already pronounced by indian high courts he might have adopted the literal construction of section 110 and in that event perhaps all controversies that subsequently arose may have 'been avoided. it now remains to indicate very briefly the position taken by different high courts in this controversy. in chittam subba rao vs vela mankanni chelamayya (1) a full bench of the madras high court was constituted to deal with this point because reported decisions of the said court showed a difference of approach and a conflict of opinion. rajamannar, c.j., who delivered the judgment of the full bench, carefully examined the previous decisions of the court and evolved three principles to govern the decision of the point. these principles have been stated in the judgment thus (i) if the judgment or decree of the high court varies the decision of the lower court in respect of a matter in controversy in the proposed appeal to the privy council, then there is a right of appeal not only to the person against whom the variation has been made, but even to the party in whose favour the variation has been made.", "completion": "chief justice rankin took the view that the only effect of the said decision was to reverse the conclusion of the calcutta high court in raja sree nath roy 's case (3) and nothing more.\nthe learned judge then proceeded to express his doubt as, to whether \"in the end even that principle would be found to be in accordance with the construction to be put upon section 110\", but he added, \"this court and other high courts have for many years acted upon that principle and i am not prepared to accept the case of annapurnabai a,;

[1953] mad. 1. 471 having evolved these principles the learned chief justice observed that every one of the decisions cited before the court can be justified by an application of the principles thus set up. it is evident from the judgment that the task which the full bench attempted to achieve was one of reconciling the different expressions of opinion found in the reported decisions of the court. in doing so more attention has naturally been paid to the said decisions and the reasons on which they were based than to the words used in article 133 itself. in regard to the said article the lear ned chief justice has observed that courts cannot add to the language actually employed and thus give an unwarranted extension to the scope of the statutory provision. \"at the same time, i do not think\", observed the learned chief justice, \"that the letter of the statutory provisions should compel a court to an unreasonable construction if it is possible to take a reasonable view by taking the letter of the provision along with its substance\". assuming that this principle can be legitimately invoked in construing a con stitutional right of making an appeal it must be borne in mind that hypothetical considerations about unreasonable consequences would not justify the imposition of a strained meaning on the relevant words used in the article. if in discussing the problem we first begin with the enquiry as to what would be reasonable, and having reached a conclusion in that behalf on a priori consideration if we seek to import that conclusion on the words used in article 133 that would not be a proper approach to adopt. the proper approach to adopt would be to take the material words as they occur in article 133 and construe them fairly and reasonably. we have already indicated our conclusion on a fair and reasonable construction of the clause. the madras decision no doubt attempted to find principles on which its previous decisions could be explained and has in fact evolved three such principles. even if these principles are assumed to be logical and consistent with each other and even if they are assumed to explain the earlier decisions of the court it does not follow that the said principles can 472 be legitimately assimilated within the scope of the article because it seems to us that unless words are added in the article and the meaning of the words used is unduly strained it would be difficult to justify the said principles as flowing from the said article. this madras view has been applied by the andhra high court in v. lakshminarayana sastry vs v. sitaramma sastry (1). the majority 'judgment of the allahabad high court in rani fateh kunwar vs raja durbijai singh( ') which in fact preceded the madras decision has adopted substantially the same approach and has come to the same conclusion. mr. justice bhargava, who agreed with the majority decision, has, however, placed his conclusions on grounds similar to those which we have adopted. to the same effect are the decisions of the assam, bombay, mysore and nagpur high courts (vide: g. c. bardoloi vs collector of kamrup (3), kapurji magniram vs pannaji debichand (4), govind dhondu kulkarni vs vishnu keshav kulkarni(5) kanakarathnammal vs v. section loganatha mudaliar(6) ramchandra vs ganpati (7). the calcutta high court has generally adopted the view taken by vs rankin, c. j., but as its decision in probodh chandra roy vs hara hari roy (8), shows the practice in the calcutta high court appears to be to treat the point as one of doubt and as chief justice chakravarti has observed \"where there is a doubt i would resolve it by deciding in favour of the applicant and granting him leave\". on the other hand, the full bench decision of the punjab high court in union of india vs kanahaya lal sham lal (9) and the majority decision of the patna high court in kanak sunder vs ram lakhan have taken the view which we have adopted. before we part with this appeal we would like to make it clear that if an appellate decree confirms the decision of the trial court but merely makes a variation in regard to the order as to costs such a variation (1) a.i.r. 1959 andh.

before or after such completion. the making of the demand is not in dispute but the dispute is as to when the sale was completed. the appellants had their residential house contiguous to the house owned by certain persons whom we may call pandeys. on january 31, 1946, the pandeys executed a deed of sale in favour of the respondent purchaser in respect of their aforesaid house. the appellants claim a right of are emption on account of this sale. the consideration mentioned in the deed was rs. 2,000. there was a subsisting mortgage on that house and the deed provided that out of the consideration a sum of rs. 200 would be left with 476 the respondent purchaser for clearing off that mortgage. the deed also recited that the pandeys had received rs. 400 and \"the remaining rs 1,400

the deed of sale from the registrar 's office on february 13, 1946. the appellants filed their suit for preemption on september 9, 1946. the suit was decreed by the trial court and this decision was maintained by the first appellate court. the high court, however, in second appeal set aside the decisions of the courts below with the result that the suit stood dismissed and 477 the appellants have now come to this court in further appeal. the mohammedan law of preemption is stated in mulla 's principles of mohammedan law in these terms: \"the right of preemption arises only out of a valid, complete and bona fide sale. \" this statement of the law is accepted by both the parties and there is no question that it is not correct. there is furthermore no dispute that the sale to the respondent purchaser was valid and bona fide. it is also agreed that one of the requisites before the right of pre emption can be exercised is the preliminary demand by the preemptor and that such demand must be made after the completion of the sale. the case has been argued before us on behalf of the appellants on the basis that the sale was governed by the . we will also proceed on that

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: the high court accepted this view and held that the sale in the pre sent case, therefore, became complete on the completion of the registration of the instrument of sale which was done on february 9, 1946 when the instrument was copied out in the books of the registration office. in this view of the matter, the high court 61 478 came to the conclusion that the appellants were not entitled to enforce their right of preemption because they had not made the preliminary demand after the completion of the sale as the law required them to do, but before, that is, on february 2, 1946. in answer to this view of the high court, the learned attorney general appearing for the appellants says that the high court overlooked section 47 of the the effect of which was to make a registered document operate from the time from which it would have commenced to operate if no registration thereof had been required and not from the time of its registration. his contention is that once a document is registered, as the deed of sale in this case was, it begins to operate from the time it would have otherwise operated and therefore, the position in this case is that the sale became operative and hence complete on january 31, 1946. the learned attorney general further contends that the proper construction of the deed of sale was that it became operative from the day it was executed and that if it was not so, it was not a sale but could only be an agreement to sell in which latter case his clients, though this present suit might fail, would be entitled, if they so desired, to enforce their right of preemption when the sale was completed in pursuance of that agreement. as authority in support of his contention that in view of section 47 of the the sale in the present case must be deemed to have been completed on the day the instrument was executed, the learned attorney general relied on bindeshri vs somnath bhadry (1) and gopal ram vs lachmi misir (2). we do not think that the learned attorney general 's contention is well founded. we will assume that the learned attorney general 's construction of the instrument of sale that the property was intended to pass under it on the date of the instrument is correct. section 47 of the does not, however, say when a sale would be deemed to be complete. it only permits a document when registered, to operate (1) a.i.r.

(1926) all. 549. 479 from a certain date which may be earlier than the date when it was registered. the object of this section is to decide which of two or more registered instruments in respect of the same property is to have a effect. the section applies to a document only after it has been registered. it has nothing to do with the completion of the registration and therefore nothing to do with the completion of a sale, when the instrument is one of sale. a sale which is admittedly not completed until the registration of the instrument of sale is completed, cannot be said to have been completed earlier because by virtue of section 47 the instrument by which it is effected, after it has been registered, commences to operate from an earlier date. therefore we do not think that the sale in this case can be said, in view of section 47, to have been completed on january 31, 1946. the view that we have taken of section 47 of the seems to have been taken in tilakdhari singh vs gour narain (1). we believe that the same view was expressed in nareshchandra datta vs gireeshchandra das (2) and gobardhan bar vs guna dhar bar (3). with regard to the two cases on which the attorney general has relied, it has to be observed that they were not concerned with a right of pre emption arising on a sale of property. bindeshri prasad 's case (4) was concerned with a suit for zar i chaharum. it does not appear from the report what that right was or when it arose. it is not possible therefore to derive much assistance from it. gopal ram 's case( ') was concerned with a right of pre emption arising on the grant of a lease and the question was whether the suit for the enforcement of such a right was barred by limitation. it appears that article 120 was applied to that suit and it was held that the cause of action for the excrcise of the right of pre emption arose as soon as the lease was executed and even before it was registered though before the actual registration the suit for pre emption could not have been maintained.

{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: \" much reliance has been placed by learned counsel for the respondent and, indeed, in the judgment of the high court, on the words the \"registration of the document shall thereupon be deemed complete\" occurring in sub section (2) of section 61. but in the context of the fasciculus of sections in which it appears it is clear that it refers to the fact that the registering officer had completed his duty and had no more to do with the document presented to him, beyond returning the original to the party entitled to receive the same. in 483 our opinion, these words have nothing to do with the time from which the transaction covered by the registered document operates or with reference to the present context, when the sale evidenced by the deed, becomes complete. specific provision is made for these in section 47 of the which reads: \"a registered document shall operate from the time from which it would have commenced to operate if no registration thereof had been required or made, and not from the time of its registration. \" the principles underlying sections 61(2) and 47 are not divergent. it is not as if, that any delay by the regis tering officer which might take place owing to the pressure of work in his office or for other reason, has any effect on the rights of parties, quod their property or the time from when the deed operates, or as regards the effectiveness of the transaction, or the priority of transactions inter se. it is not as if, documents executed on different dates, the parties intending them to operate at different times, have their intentions modified, if not nullified by the action or inaction of the registering officer, or any delay that might take place in his office. a contention that though the muslim law of sale is superseded by the and the , but yet the provision contained in section 47 of the is inapplicable to determine when a sale effected by a registered instrument should be complete could not be sustained on any principle or logic, or of course on any rule of interpretation of statutes. in our opinion no distinction is possible to be drawn between a sale which is effective and one which is complete since they are merely different forms of expressing the same concept and for the same reason between the time from when a sale becomes effective and when it should be held to be complete. as under muslim law the talabs have to be performed only immediately after the preemptor receives information of the sale, the view we take of the applicability of section 47 of the , introduces no element of hardship in the exercise of the option. we are, therefore, clearly of the opinion that the time when the sale becomes complete so as to 484 entitle the preemptor to perform the talabs should be determined by the application of the principle of intention laid down in section 47 of the which is as much a part of the positive law governing the right of preemption as the provision of section 54 of the which, requires a registered instrument to effect a sale which gives rise to a right of preemption. if, therefore, b. 47 of the should apply to determine the time from which the registered document should have effect or, in other words, the time from which the sale should be held to be complete, the intention of the parties would be the crucial and only test. that has to be gathered by reference to the document itself read in the light of the surrounding circumstances, with however a proviso that if the document were clear and its terms explicit, no evidence to contradict them would be admissible. paragraph 4 of this document of the sale deed exhibit 'a ' dated january 31, 1946 recites the consideration for the same. this was to consist of rs. 2,000. out of this, it states that the vendors had received rs. 400 in cash at the time of the execution of the document, and that rs. 200 had been left with the purchaser for payment to a previous possessory mortgagee. in regard to the balance of rs. 1,400 the recital reads: \"and received the remaining sum of rs. 1,400 in cash at the time of exchange of equivalents, (that is) at the time of handing over of the receipt of this deed. in this manner we have received the entire amount of consideration money for this vended property from the claimant and brought the same to our possession and use. \" it is, no doubt, true that the sum of rs. 1,400 had not been received on january 31, 1946, the date of the execution of the document and that it was agreed that sum would be paid in exchange for the delivery of the receipt obtained from the registrar in respect of the sale deed presented for registration. but the use of the past tense clearly indicates that the vendor agreed to the promise to pay the balance of rs. 1,400 as the consideration for the execution of the 485 document on january 31, 1946, as tantamount to an actual

the judgment of the court was delivered by raghubar dayal, j. civil appeal no. 635 of 1957 is an appeal, by certificate, and raises the question regarding the effect of the abatement of the appeal, by the state of punjab, against labhu ram, one of the respondents, on the state appeal against nathu ram, co respondent. civil appeals nos. 636 to 641 of 1957 also raise the same question between the same parties. the facts leading to the appeal are that the punjab government acquired on lease certain parcels of land belonging to labhu rain and nathu ram, for different military purposes, under the defence of india act, 81 638 1939 (xxxv of 1939). labhu ram and nathu ram, brothers, refused to accept the compensation offered to them by the collector and applied to the punjab government, through the collector, under r. 6 of the punjab land acquisition (defence of india) rules, 1943, hereinafter called the rules, as amended by the notification of the punjab government no. 1444 hm44/19124, dated 10th march, 1944, and published in the punjab gazette, part 1, dated 17th march, 1944 (home department). the state government referred the matter to an arbitrator as required under r. 10, who, after enquiry, passed an award ordering the payment of an amount higher than what was offered by the collector and also ordered the payment of certain amount on account of income tax which would be paid on the compensation received. the state government appealed against the award to the high court of punjab. during the pendency of the appeal, labhu ram, one of the respondents, died. the high court, holding that the appeal abated against labhu ram and that its effect was that the appeal against nathu ram also abated, dismissed the appeal. it also dismissed the cross objections. the state government applied for a certificate of fitness of the case for appeal to this court and the high court granted it, as questions of great private and public importance were involved. it is not disputed that in view of 0. xxii, r. 4, civil procedure code, hereinafter called the code, the appeal abated against labhu ram, deceased, when no application for bringing on record his legal representatives had been made within the time limited by law. the code does not provide for the abatement of the appeal against the other respondents. courts have held that in certain circumstances, the appeals against the co respondents would also abate as a result of the abatement of the appeal against the deceased respondent. they have not been always agreed with respect to the result of the particular cir cumstances of a case and there has been, consequently, divergence of opinion in the application of the principle. it will serve no useful purpose to consider the cases. suffice it to say that when 0. xxii, r. 4 does 639 not provide for the abatement of the appeals against the co respondents of the deceased respondent, there can be no question of abatement of the appeals against them. to say that the appeals against them abated in certain circumstances, is not a correct statement. of course, the appeals against them cannot proceed in certain circumstances and have therefore to be dismissed. such a result depends on the nature of the relief sought in the appeal. the same conclusion is to be drawn from the provisions of 0. 1, r. 9, of the code which provides that no suit shall be defeated by reason of the misjoinder or non joiner of parties and the court may, in every suit, deal with the matter in controversy so far as regards the rights and interests of the parties actually before it. it follows, therefore, that if the court can deal with the matter in controversy so far as regards the rights and interests of the appellant and the respondents other than the deceased respondent, it has to proceed with the appeal and decide it. it is only when it is not possible for the court to deal with such matters, that it will have to refuse to proceed further with the appeal and therefore dismiss it. the question whether a court can deal with such matters or not, will depend on the facts of each case and therefore no exhaustive statement can be made about the circumstances when this is possible or is not possible. it may, however, be stated that ordinarily the considerations which weigh with the court in deciding upon this question are whether the appeal between the appellants and the respondents other than the deceased can be said to be properly constituted or can be said to have all the necessary parties for the decision of the controversy before the court. the test to determine this has been described in diverse forms.", "completion": "635 of 1957 is an appeal, by certificate, and raises the question regarding the effect of the abatement of

to a decision which be in conflict with the decision between the appellant and the deceased respondent and therefore which would lead to the court 's passing a decree which will be contradictory to the decree which had become final with respect to 640 the same subject matter between the appellant and the deceased respondent; (b) when the appellant could not have brought the action for the necessary relief against those respondents alone who are still before the court and (c) when the decree against the surviving respondents, if the appeal succeeds, be ineffective, that is to say, it could not be successfully executed. there has been no divergence between the courts about the court 's proceeding with the appeal between the respondents other than the deceased respondent, when the decree in appeal was not a joint decree in favour of all the respondents. the abatement of the appeal against the deceased respondent, in such a case, would make the decree in his favour alone final, and this can, in no circumstances, have a repercussion, on the decision of the controversy between the appellant and the other decree holders or on the execution of the ultimate decree between them. the difficulty arises always when there is a joint decree. here again, the consensus of opinion is that if the decree is joint and indivisible, the appeal against the other respondents also will not be proceeded with and will have to be dismissed as a result of the abatement of the appeal against the deceased respondent. different views exist in the case of joint decrees in favour of respondents whose rights in the subject matter of the decree are specified. one view is that in such cases, the abatement of the appeal against the deceased respondent will have the result of making the decree affecting his specific interest to be final and that the decree against the other respondents can be suitably dealt with by the appellate court. we do not consider this view correct. the specification of shares or of interest of the deceased respondent does not affect the nature of the decree and the capacity of the joint decree holder to execute the entire decree or to resist the attempt of the other party to interfere with the joint right decreed in his favour. the abatement of an appeal means not only that the decree between the appellant, and the deceased respondent has become final, but also, as a necessary corollary, 641 that the appellate court cannot, in any way, modify that decree directly or indirectly. the reason is plain. it is that in the absence of the legal representatives of the deceased respondents, the appellate court cannot determine anything between the appellant and the legal representatives which may affect the rights of the legal representatives under the decree. it is immaterial that the modification which the court will do is one to which exception can or cannot be taken. it is therefore necessary to determine, on the facts of this case, whether the state appeal could proceed against nathu ram. the award of the arbitrator in each of these cases was a joint one, in favour of both the respondents labhu ram and nathu ram. to illustrate the form of the award, we may quote the award for the year 1945 46 in the proceedings leading to civil appeal no. 635 of 1957. it is: \"on the basis of the report of section lal singh, naib tehsildar (exhibit p. w. 9/1) and sheikh aziz din, tehsildar, exhibit p. w. 9/2, the applicants are entitled to a sum of rs. 4,140 on account of rent, plus rs. 3,872 8 0 on account of income tax etc., due to the inclusion of rs. 6,193 8 0 in their total income, plus such sum as the petitioners have to pay to the income tax department on account of the inclusion of rs. 4,140 in their income as awarded by this award.\" the result of the abatement of the appeal against labhu ram is therefore that his legal representatives are entitled to get compensation on the basis of this award, even if they are to be paid separately on calculating their rightful share in the land acquired, for which this compensation is decreed. such calculation is foreign to the appeal between the state of punjab and nathu ram, the decree in the appeal will have to determine not what nathu ram 's share in this compensation is, but what is the correct amount of compensation with respect to the land acquired for which this compensation has been awarded by the arbitrator. the subject matter for which the compensation is to be calculated is one and 642 the same. there cannot be different assessments of the amounts of compensation for the same parcel of land. the appeal before the high court was an appeal against a decree jointly in favour of labhu ram and nathu ram. the appeal against nathu ram alone cannot be held to be properly constituted when the appeal against labhu ram bad abated. to get rid of the joint decree, it was essential for the appellant, the state of punjab, to implead both the joint decree holders in the appeal. in the absence of one joint decree holder, the appeal is not properly framed. it follows the that state appeal against nathu ram alone cannot proceed.", "completion": "there has

(2) 862 adopting that course may be doubted when the plea cannot be disposed of without deciding nice questions of fact in considering which the court of ultimate review is placed in a much less advantageous position than the courts below.\" mr. setalvad, however, urged that the appellant should not be allowed to rely on section 18 now for the first time and that even if fraud within the meaning of that section had been pleaded the respondent might have adduced counter evidence by himself going into the witness box or otherwise. according to him, the approach to the question of fraud under section 18 of the limitation act is quite different from the approach under section 48 of the civil procedure code. there may be cases where the fraud alleged and found is fraud in the wider sense of the term within the meaning of section 48 (2) of the civil procedure code, but the same facts do not amount to fraud as strictly construed under section 18 of the limitation act. the fact that the decree holder in the lower courts relied on section 48, civil procedure code, only does not prevent him from relying on section 18 of the limitation act if the facts necessary to be established for bringing in the assistance of section 18 of the limitation act are admitted, or proved. it is not disputed that the fraud contemplated by section 18 of the limitation act is of a different type from the fraud contem plated by section 48 (2) of the civil procedure code. the wording of section 18 which requires the fraud \"to prevent knowledge of the right to make the application\" is neces sarily of a different nature from the fraud which prevents the decree holder from making an application for execution. conceding to the appellant the right to rely on section 18 of the limitation act even at this late stage, let us see if it is really of any help to him on the facts found. the section has been quoted already. it speaks of the right to institute a suit or make an application which by means of fraud has been kept from the knowledge of the person having the right or the title on which it is founded. the right to apply for 863 execution of a decree like the one before us is a single and indivisible right, and not a composite right consisting of different smaller rights and based on the decree holder 's remedies to proceed against the person of the judgment debtor or his properties, moveable and immoveable. togive such a meaning would be to split up the single right into parcels and to enable the decree holder to contend that while his right to proceed against a particular item of property is barred, it is not barred in respect of other items. we would then be face to face with different periods of limitation as regards one and the same decree. an inter pretation which leads to this result is prima facie un sound. both sides agreed that this is the true position, but they reached it from slightly varying standpoints. according to the appellant, fraud even with reference to one property gives him a further extension of 12 years under section 48 (2) as regards the whole decree and it is not necessary for him to show that he had proceeded against the other properties of the judgment debtor. according to the respondent, the fraud must consist in the concealment of the knowledge of the decree holder 's right to apply for execution of the decree and it is not enough to prove or establish that the fraud prevented him from ' proceeding against a specific item. the two contentions, lead to the same conclusion about the indivisibility of the decree, but along different lines. in our opinion, the facts necessary to establish fraud under section 18 of the limitation act are neither admitted nor proved in the present case.", "completion": "if the facts proved and found as established are sufficient to make out a case of fraud within the meaning of section 18, this objection may not be serious, as the question of the applicability of the section will be only a question of law and such a question could be raised at any stage of the case and also in the final court of appeal.\naccording to him, the approach to the question of fraud under section 18 of the limitation act is quite different from the approach under section 48 of the civil procedure code.\nthere may be cases where the fraud alleged and found is fraud in the wider sense of the term within the meaning of section 48 (2) of the civil procedure code, but the same facts do not amount to fraud as strictly construed under section 18 of the limitation act.\nthe fact that the decree holder in the lower courts relied on section 48, civil procedure code, only does not prevent him from relying on section 18 of the limitation act if the facts necessary to be established for bringing in the assistance of section 18 of the limitation act are admitted, or proved.\nin our opinion, the facts necessary to establish fraud under section 18 of the limitation act are neither admitted nor proved in the present case."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: concealing from a person the knowledge of his right to apply for execution of a decree is undoubtedly different from preventing him from exercising his right, of which he has knowledge. section 18 of the limitation act postulates the former alternative. to read it as referring to an application for execution to proceed against a particular property would be destructive of the oneness of the decree and would lead to multiplicity of periods of limitation. it is true that articles 181 and 182 of the limitation act and section 48, 864 civil procedure code, should be read together. the articles expressly refer to the section. but they are independent or parallel provisions, different in their scope and object. as held in kalyanasundaram pillai vs vaithilinga vanniar (1) section 48 (2) extends the 12 years ' period of closure by a further period of similar duration but the necessity of resort to article 182 is not thereby obviated. the decree holder must have been taking steps to keep the decree alive and the only circumstance that could relieve him of this obligation is the existence of fraud under section 18 of the limitation act. the learned advocate of the appellant asked how it could be possible for him to apply in execution when there was the fraud and whether the law contemplated that, even though the fraud prevented execution of the decree, he was to go on filing useless or futile applications every three years merely for keeping the decree alive. the answer is simple. the fraud pleaded namely suppression of owner ship of the 'prabhat ' newspaper, did not conceal from him his right to make an application for execution of the de cree. indeed, the suppression, which began in 1938, did not prevent the decree holder from applying for execution in 19 10; and in his answers in cross examination, he has adimitted that there were other properties to his knowledge against which he could have sought execution, viz., deposits in several banks of the judgment debtor 's monies but stand ing in his wife 's or daughter 's names, life insurance poli cies for which premia were being paid by him, law books written and published by him, movable properties in the house at poona etc. as a matter of fact, the appellant 's present application seeks execution against several of these properties. nothing prevented him therefore ,from seeking such execution within 3 years of the dismissal of his prior application in 1940. even with reference to the 'prabhat ', all that the decree holder states is that as he had no evidence to prove that the concern belonged to the defendant he did not take any steps, and not that he had no (1) i,l.r. 1939 mad.611 865 knowledge of the ownership. to quote two sentences from his deposition: \"i had suspected that defendant no. 1 was the real owner of the business all the while. but i had no posi tive knowledge or information till 1946\" . . \"i could not take any step for attaching the defendant 's business till 1946 as i had no evidence to prove the defendant 's fraud till then. \" there is no obligation on the judgment debtor to post the decree holder with all details of his properties; it is the decree holder 's business to gather knowledge about the properties so that he can realise the fruits of his decree. in dealing with this evidence, mr. krishnaswami lyengar relied on the privy council decision, rahimbhoy vs turner in 20 i.a. 1 and referred to the following observation of lord hobhouse at page \"but their lordships consider, and in this they agree with both the courts below, that all that the appellant rahimbhoy has done is to show that some clues and hints reached the assignee in the year 1881, which perhaps, if vigorously and acutely followed up, might have led to a complete knowledge of the fraud, but that there was no disclosure made which informed the mind of the assignee that the insolvent 's estate had been defrauded by rahimbhoy of these assets in the year 1867. \" the passage cited does not apply here because the appellant admits knowledge, which is more than a mere suspicion, but states that he had no evidence to prove the defendant 's ownership. in any event, it has not been established within the meaning of section 18 of the limitation act that the fraud alleged and proved kept back from him the knowledge of his right to execute the decree. it is thus clear that the appellant cannot get the benefit of section 18 of the limitation act. it was next argued on behalf of the appellant that under section 48(2) of the civil procedure code, because of the fraud of the respondent the appellant got a fresh starting point of limitation for the limitation act also 111 866 and therefore the starting point contemplated in the third column of the schedule to the limitation act relating to applications for execution should be the date when the fraud was discovered by the appellant. in other words, it was argued that the effect of section 48 was not merely to make the 12 years ' period start from the discovery of fraud for the purpose of section 48(2) of the civil procedure code but also to give a fresh starting point for the schedule to the limitation act. this argument cannot be accepted. if a man is prevented from making an application, because of the fraud of the debtor, he is not necessarily prevented from knowing his right to make the application.", "completion": "the decree holder must have been taking steps to keep the decree alive and the only circumstance that could relieve him of this obligation is the existence of fraud under section 18 of the limitation act.\nthe learned advocate of the appellant asked how it could be possible for him to apply in execution when there was the fraud and whether the law contemplated that, even though the fraud prevented execution of the decree, he was to go on filing useless or futile applications every three years merely for keeping the decree alive.\nin any event, it has not been established within the meaning of section 18 of the limitation act that the fraud alleged and proved kept back from him the knowledge of his right to execute the decree.\nit was next argued on behalf of the appellant that under section 48(2) of the civil procedure code, because of the fraud of the respondent the appellant got a fresh starting point of limitation for the limitation act also 111 866 and therefore the starting point contemplated in the third column of the schedule to the limitation act relating to applications for execution should be the date when the fraud was discovered by the appellant.\nin other words, it was argued that the effect of section 48 was not merely to make the 12 years ' period start from the discovery of fraud for the purpose of section 48(2) of the civil procedure code but also to give a fresh starting point for the schedule to the limitation act."}
{"prompt": "Act as a legal assistant and generate a summary of the following legal document: by the enactment of section 18, the legislature has distinctly contemplated that for the limitation act the starting point is changed on the ground of fraud, only when the knowledge of the right to make the application is prevented by the fraud of the judg mentdebtor. having the knowledge that he had the right to make the application, if the judgment debtor prevents the decree holder from knowing the existence of certain properties against which the decree could be enforced, the case is clearly not covered by the words of section 18 of the limitation act. therefore the argument advanced on behalf of the appellant is unsound. it was urged that the various starting points mentioned in the third column to article 182 of the limitation act cannot apply because none of them specify a fresh starting point for execution acquired on the ground of the fraud of the judgment debtor. this argument, in our opinion, instead of helping the appellant, goes against him. such a provision in the third column in the article relating to execution of decrees is not necessary because provision for such a con tingency is made in section 18. affirmatively, by the inclu sion of section 18 in the limitation act, and, negatively, by not providing for a separate period of limitation in the case of the fraud of the judgment debtor in the third column in the articles, the legislature has clearly indicated that unless advantage could be taken by the 867 decree holder under section 18 on the ground of the fraud of the judgment debtor, fraud does not give any other relief under the limitation act. this scheme of the legislature is not inconsistent with section 48 of the civil procedure code. the two provisions in the two acts have to be read as related to the same subject but dealing with two differents aspects. without section 48 of the civil procedure code a decree holder, if he made applications as required by arti cle 181 or 182 of the limitation act, could keep his decree alive for an indefinite period. the legislature, as a matter of policy, ruled that a decree of a civil court (but excluding the high court) shall not be kept alive for more than 12 years, although all necessary steps are taken under the limitation act to keep the decree alive and operative. that is one limit to the right of the decree holder to enforce the decree of the court. the second limitation to his right, which is independent of the first, is that he must keep the decree alive under article 182 or 181, as the case may be. in the case of the fraud of the judgment debtor provision is made in section 48(2) for enlarging the 12 years period prescribed under section 48. for defeating the plea of the bar of limitation under the limitation act, in the case of fraud of the judgment debtor, provision is found in section 18 of the limitation act. if the particu lar case of fraud set up and proved is not covered by those words, there is no protection against the same in the limi tation act. read in that way, the two legislative provi sions are neither conflicting nor overlapping; and they are capable of operating harmoniously, as they deal with different situations and circumstances. the argument ad vanced on behalf of the appellant that because of the fraud he got not merely a fresh starting point for computing the 12 years period prescribed in section 48 ( '2,) of the civil procedure code but is also entitled to an extension of the time under the limitation act, must therefore fail. the second contention urged on behalf of the appellant that because in the third column of article 182 868 fraud is not mentioned, the case is covered by article 181 does not also appear to be sound. the third column in article 182 prescribes the starting point of limitation under different specified circumstances. it does not, and indeed need not, mention the ground of fraud because if fraud of the kind against which the limitation act contem plates relief, as prescribed in section 18 of the limitation act, is established, the time is automatically altered by operation of that section. if the case does not fall under that section, no relief is permitted under the limitation act and the starting point for computing the period must be as mentioned in the third column, irrespective of the question of fraud. in our opinion, therefore, the conten tion that because of the fraud established in the present case under section 48(2) of the civil procedure code, the appellant gets a fresh starting point of limitation under article 182 of the limitation act is unacceptable. the appellant relied on the general principle of juris prudence that fraud stops or suspends the running of time and that it should be applied in his favour, apart from section 18 of the limitation act. rules of equity have no application. where there are definite statutory provisions specifying the grounds on the basis of which alone the stoppage or suspension of running of time can arise. while the courts necessarily are astute in checkmating or fighting fraud, it should be equally borne in mind that statutes of limitation are statutes of repose. for the reasons given above we concur in the conclusion reached by the high court and dismiss the appeal with costs. appeal dismissed.", "completion": "it was urged that the various starting points mentioned in the third column to article 182 of the limitation act cannot apply because none of them specify a fresh starting point for execution acquired on the ground of the fraud of the judgment debtor.\naffirmatively, by the inclu sion of section 18 in the limitation act, and, negatively, by not providing for a separate period of limitation in the case of the fraud of the judgment debtor in the third column in the articles, the legislature has clearly indicated that unless advantage could be taken by the 867 decree holder under section 18 on the ground of the fraud of the judgment debtor, fraud does not give any other relief under the limitation act.\nthe argument ad vanced on behalf of the appellant that because of the fraud he got not merely a fresh starting point for computing the 12 years period prescribed in section 48 ( '2,) of the civil procedure code but is also entitled to an extension of the time under the limitation act, must therefore fail.\nif the case does not fall under that section, no relief is permitted under the limitation act and the starting point for computing the period must be as mentioned in the third column, irrespective of the question of fraud.\nin our opinion, therefore, the conten tion that because of the fraud established in the present case under section 48(2) of the civil procedure code, the appellant gets a fresh starting point of limitation under article 182 of the limitation act is unacceptable."}
